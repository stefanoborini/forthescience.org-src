Did you know that iguanas (and not only them) have three eyes ?  The feature is
called `Parietal eye <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_eye>`_, it is
highly advantageous to spot the shadow of a predator coming from above, and
it's not unique to iguanas, but it can be found in frogs, lizards, sharks and
other reptiles and fishes. In the `Tuatara
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara>`_ the eye is way more developed, but it
regresses as the animal gets older. All these eyes can influence the `pineal
gland <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland>`_, apparently responsible for
the `circadian rhythm <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm>`_
regulation.
