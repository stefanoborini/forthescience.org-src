The readers of my blog will certainly know that I am extremely
responsive to the earthquakes and the destruction they leave behind. I
covered `the Japanese
quake <http://forthescience.org/blog/2011/03/11/the-japanese-quake/>`_
in rather detail, `exploring the seismic activity as it
developed <http://forthescience.org/blog/2011/03/18/plotting-seismic-events-in-japan-in-2d-and-3d/>`_.
The Japanese quake was deeply emotional for me, and I lived in Tokyo for
just one year. This time it hit my city, my home town.

Ferrara is a rather small city in Italy, sitting in the Pianura Padana,
one of the very few flat areas in Italy. It's a nice city with a nice
university and a surrounding countryside focusing on rural traditions
that are hundred years old. Due to the proximity to the Po river, the
major source of danger are floods. Our city, and its inhabitants are
deeply unprepared for a quake, both psychologically and technically. The
last major quake in the area `dates back to
1570 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1570_Ferrara_earthquake>`_, where it
contributed to the decline of the city.

The one happened a few days ago is a major quake. With 6.0 Richter, it's
the maximum you can get from the local geological situation. The Po
valley is actually hiding, under a pile of sediments deployed by the
river, the interaction between the Apennins and the Alps. The quake that
hit the city arises from this interaction. Damages are considerable, in
particular in the West side of the province, close to the epicenter.
Seven people lost their lives. A lot of buildings, churches and towers
often dating back to the middle ages collapsed. Even a part of Ferrara's
iconic castle collapsed. The loss of the historical heritage is immense.
The loss for the people's houses are atrocious and hit a population
which is among the oldest in Italy. The psychological effect has been
considerable, but people organized, with courage, equilibrium and
commitment.

Now more than ever, I ask anyone willing to provide support to perform a
donation at the public donation fund from the `newspaper Il Resto del
Carlino and
TG5. <http://qn.quotidiano.net/cronaca/2012/05/22/716674-terremoto-emilia-carlino-aiuti-sottoscrizione-conto-corrente.shtml>`_

A translation for the fields:

-  Intestatario: account owner
-  Banca: Bank
-  Causale: reason for transfer

Apparently there is no BIC available. I will update this post if I find
more information about it. I will try to perform a donation tomorrow,
and I will certainly have to find it.

Edit: Apparently any BIC for the bank will work. Your online banking
should propose the correct one depending on the bank name (at least mine
does). I decided skip the donation, and instead I am organizing to go
there and provide some help to the locals.
