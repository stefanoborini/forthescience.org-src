The McNaught comet, or `C/2009
R1 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/2009_R1>`_, is likely to be visible
in the night sky starting tonight, for a week. You should be able to
spot it near the constellation of Perseus as a fuzzy streak of light.

The comet should be visible with a small binocular, or just with the
naked eye. In particular, I recommend using the so-called `averted
vision <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averted_vision>`_: don't look
directly at the comet, but do it laterally, with your peripheral vision.
This same technique can be used to watch any faint objects, such as
galaxies and nebulae. You will also need a clear sky and low light
pollution: leave the city and get in the countryside. I suggest also
adapting your eyes to darkness for 10-15 minutes by not looking at
anything bright, eventually bringing with you a flashlight with a dark
red filter (which ruins your darkness vision much less than white
light). If you have a telescope, prefer 25 or even 40 mm
`eyepieces <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyepiece>`_, which give better
contrast and a large field of view.

To find the constellation of Perseus, you have to know how to stargaze
and orient yourself in the night sky. It should be in the Northeast,
well into the night (2-3 am or even later). In the northern hemisphere,
to approximately find the North look at the direction of sunset (West);
at your right is the North, behind you is the East, and at your left is
the South. Perseus can be found in a streak of sky between the `big
dipper <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_dipper>`_ (four almost
rectangular bright stars and a curved handle made of three stars) and
`Cassiopeia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassiopeia_%28constellation%29>`_,
which has an unmistakable W shape. Both these constellations can be
found in the North direction. Move your eyes towards East along this
band of sky.
`Perseus <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus_%28constellation%29>`_
looks like a `Pi symbol <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi>`_ (you will
probably have to mentally rotate it), the size of your fist at arm's
length.

While we are into comets, I recently dug into old night sky pictures I
took years ago of the great comet `Hale
Bopp <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hale_Bopp>`_ in 1997. It was an
impressive comet, inspiring awe for its beauty, size and colored double
tail (and also comet panic and mass cult suicide. Rings some bell ?). In
1997, photography was still a chemical film affair, so I created the
digital image by scanning the printed film and adjusting the colors with
a little `GIMP <http://www.gimp.org/>`_ to remove the strong
yellow/green hue resulting from light pollution and film composition
effects. Pics have been taken with my camera, a `Nikon
Nikkormat <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkormat>`_ with a 125 mm lens
and a 400 ISO film, mounted in a "parallel scope" position on my
telescope (a 114/1000 mm
`Newtonian <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_telescope>`_) with a
self-built connector. With such configuration I could take long shots
(some second or even minutes) by taking the picture with the camera,
while at the same time carefully following a reference star with the
telescope. This technique allows to counteract the Earth's rotation by
hand, and obtain single spots of light instead of streaks. It takes some
practice and tricks to setup the telescope mount properly and not
introduce accidental vibrations, but the result is pleasing and (very
important for a student) rather cheap. Unfortunately, only a really dark
sky allows long exposure time and well contrasted result, and light
pollution in Italy was (and still is) very high. This picture has been
taken from the banks of a river, with some seconds of exposure time,
then digitally imported and corrected

You can see a comparison against the original, non-corrected picture in
the following image, on the right hand side. The strong yellow/green hue
is evident, as well as the poor contrast and saturation

Another picture of the same subject, again with digital correction
applied. I tried a nice shot with the cloud merging with the comet tail,
a relatively successful attempt. I also got an airplane

`|image3| <http://forthescience.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/halebopp-2-web.jpg>`_

Overall, not really great results (on the internet you will find much
better pictures), but the original I took is much worse, and my skills
with digital image correction techniques are basically nil. I also tried
to remove light pollution by subtracting a blurred version of the image,
but the result was unpleasant, resulting in a strong "halo effect" at
the border between the trees and the sky.
