This is a `very interesting
application <http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/cells/scale/>`_
that should convey you an idea of the size of small things: from a
coffee bean down to a small carbon atom. It pairs with this `movie about
the size of planets and
stars <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTmYmvRk_k8>`_. Fascinating and
humbling.
