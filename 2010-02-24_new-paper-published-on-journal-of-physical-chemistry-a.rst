The paper I submitted some time ago at the Journal of Physical Chemistry
A has been published: Borini S, Limacher PA, Luethi HP, `"Structural
Features Analysis and Nonlinearity of End-Cap-Substituted
Polyacetylenes" <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp908439x>`_, DOI:
10.1021/jp908439x

I already wrote about the `findings reported in this
paper <http://forthescience.org/blog/2009/12/19/nonlinear-optics-with-polymers/>`_
at the time it was accepted. It is a very nice paper, and the very
highly reputed journal makes me even more comfortable of its content
being cool and insightful, in particular for experimentalists.
