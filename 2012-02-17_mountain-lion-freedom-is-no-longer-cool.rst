This is a rant.

Here is a 10 years long Apple customer, generally satisfied with the
quality of the product, but my stance started to change recently, and
radically. Apple is pushing it too far. As I smelled long ago with the
introduction of the App marketplace, their plan apparently is to make
OSX like iOS: Apple uniquely decides what can or can't run on your
computer, it can remove software remotely from your device, force you to
pay to develop and release your software, wants to inspect your code to
approve it, and wants a share of your profits. If you didn't expect it,
then take a look at `Mountain Lion "Gatekeeper"
option <http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/security.html>`_,
which, rest assured, will magically disappear as soon as convenient.
Possible scenarios include:

-  Your software is "politically incorrect"? Won't work on macs.
-  Your software competes with Apple's applications ? Won't work on
   macs.
-  Your software is stomping on someone else's feet? Won't work on macs.
-  Want to write some code ? Pay the Apple tribute or it won't work on
   macs.
-  Have a scripting language interpreter ? Won't work on macs.

I left Windows because I considered it a trap, and I moved to Linux. I
then left Linux for OSX because it gave me the freedom of a Unix
environment with a nice and polished interface. I am not your slave
Apple. Keep your controlling crap away from my computer, away from my
life.
