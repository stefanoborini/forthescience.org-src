In this final post, I want to give some form of grocery list to get an
idea of the reliability of scientific communication performed by general
purpose media. To do this, I necessarily had to introduce some
nomenclature in the previous posts, in particular about citations, type
of article, structure of an article, Impact Factors, and h-Index. This
nomenclature will now become useful.

Suppose you read an article on your local newspaper, claiming some new
impressive scientific breakthrough, something like

**"crocodile tears make you lose weight"**

The article details how Professor Whatever at University of Smart People
reports in a recent article on Journal of Succulent Science how a
substance contained in crocodile tears, Vitamin Z, can increase
metabolism and therefore make you lose weight, according to his
research. The message of the article is that a daily dose of crocodile
tears will burn fat away.

Not so fast, I say. The claim is unlikely to be that simple. It has been
simplified to make it accessible, but reality is much more complex. You
may need to check a bit the assertions, the reputation of the involved
parties, and the actual result of the research. Let's go with reputation
first:

#. Check the **reputation of the journalist**. Is he qualified as a
   scientific journalist ? Does he or she have a good background in the
   science and scientific terms of the discipline he or she is
   presenting ? This point allows you to get an idea of how much he
   understood about the research result, and how much is hyperbole.
#. Check the **reputation of the scientific journal** of the cited
   scientific article. Is it a real journal, or just something that is
   named with a sciencey name, but it's not a reputed journal. When was
   the journal started? Does it have a good impact factor?
#. Check the **reputation of the authors of the scientific paper**. What
   is their h-Index ? To which institution are they affiliated ? Are
   there any conflicts of interest that may bias the evaluation ?
#. Did the journalist get the information he presents directly from the
   paper, or from an agency? How many steps happened between the
   information source and the journalist?

You should then proceed to question the claim

#. Does the result arise from new research (therefore more likely to
   have bias due to smaller sampling groups for a preliminary
   assessment) or from a review, which is likely to have larger samples
   and more accurate and additional considerations?
#. How much active substance is needed to deliver the presented result,
   and how much raw material do you have to drink/eat in order to obtain
   the requested amount of active component in your body? Suppose you
   would have to drink 4 liters of crocodile tears per day, would you do
   it, and would it be easy and cheap to obtain them, even if you
   technically could drink them?
#. Does the substance become available in the body, or does it get
   expelled or undigested unless administered through unconventional
   methods? IV injection is a very unpleasant way to get substances in
   your body. If it's a food, does it break down if you cook it, and
   cooking is the only way of eating it ?
#. Was the experiment performed on humans, on laboratory mice, or on
   yeast cells ? Mice can be a valid prototype organism for human in
   most cases, but metabolism can be different, and so is the effect
   considering the different weight of a mouse and a human.
#. How many people were used in the experiment ? 10, or 10.000? Size of
   the sample is very important. Results on a small sample may be due to
   random chance, or a particular sensitivity (or lack thereof) of that
   particular set of people to the substance. Were the selected people
   all of the same ethnicity, age, sex, or lifestyle, or were these
   effects different among the group ? Was there a placebo control ? If
   you take a group of healthy, young students at the end of winter and
   want to check if crocodile tears has an effect in losing weight, you
   may obtain a (wrong) positive answer: in reality they lost weight
   because with Spring outside, they started biking more.
#. Suppose the claimed effect actually exists, but it allows you to lose
   only 20 grams per month. Does it really matter in practice ?
#. Is the presence of an effect factual (e.g. some sort of metabolism
   increase) but the conclusion far fetched (losing weight) ? How well
   are the actual signal and the claimed outcome correlated?
#. If the proposed substance is a drug, has it already passed all the
   clinical trial phases? Promising drugs may be cut short and never see
   the market because of troublesome effects found during trials.

I mostly focused on health. What about new exceptional technologies to
solve problems we know to have, and problems we didn't know we have?

#. Does the technology stated actually lasts, or it degrades within a
   few days or months? Does it still carry potential problems such as
   excessive fragility?
#. Does it introduce new problems, such as higher pollution? What is the
   strategy to deal with these new problems?
#. Is the material needed to produce the technology enough? Some
   materials are intrinsically rare, and this may limit the impact of
   the technology to a very small number of people, unlikely to have a
   relevant effect on the broader market.
#. Is the promised technology able to push aside the legacy and habits
   of its future customers?

There may be many additional remarks to check, but in general the safest
approach is to remember that

-  if it's too good to be true, it probably isn't, or there may be a
   catch
-  if it's too simple, important details have been probably left out.
-  `beware of the telephone
   game <http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1174>`_
-  beware of incorrect use of statistics

but as a counter-argument, remember that only through knowledge we can
understand better what is presented. Skepticism is good as long as it is
knowledgeable skepticism. Ignorant skepticism is as bad as ignorant
acceptance.
