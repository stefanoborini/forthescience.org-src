Smashing a car at the speed of sound

Since I moved abroad, I rediscovered good TV. And Mythbuster is
definitely an interesting show. Adam and Jamie are so fantastic in
exceeding expectations every time. But this time, they did more.

So, the legend says that two trucks smashing onto each other pancake a
car so badly that nobody is able to spot it in the remaining of the
aftermath. So to either confirm or disprove it, they smashed the trucks
for real, but the car was not pancaked as the legend says. As is typical
from Adam and Jamie, they push the conditions to the limit so to verify
what are the real parameters that would be needed to achieve the desired
effect: they shoot a metal missile at the speed of sound against a car,
using a two-stages rocket sledge. See it by yourself.

What amazes me the most is the slow motion capture of the event. The car
gets literally erased in the process. In one shot toward the end you can
also see the air waveshock due to the achieved speed.
