Hello

This is a lateral blog of my main blog
"`ForTheScience.org <http://forthescience.org/blog>`_". While the latter
is mostly concerned about science, programming, and scientific
programming, this blog will mainly focus on my personal adventures in
outdoor and non-computer-related activities, such as gardening,
beekeeping, and cooking (Italian cooking, specifically), with a strong
accent on discovery and experimentation that can be useful to others.

The posting schedule will be not as regular as on ForTheScience, but it
will follow the seasonal events, and the failed or successful
experiments I perform.
