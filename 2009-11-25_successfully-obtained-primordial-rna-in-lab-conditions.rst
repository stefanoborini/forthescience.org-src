A groundbreaking paper "`Generation of long RNA chains in
water <http://www.jbc.org/content/early/2009/10/02/jbc.M109.041905>`_"
from Costanzo, Pino, Ciciriello and Di Mauro on Journal of Biological
Chemistry proposes conditions for the obtainment of complex RNA chains
from cyclic nucleotides. The proposed conditions are typical for the
pre-biotic Earth: hot springs and puddles with water at moderate
temperature (40 to 90 C), without any organic or inorganic catalysis,
with simply obtainable cyclic nucleotides. This allowed the formation of
long RNA chains carrying the first genetic information, starting the
natural selection process of improvement. The results on this paper
propose an effective and important advancement for the last piece of the
puzzle of evolution: how everything started.
