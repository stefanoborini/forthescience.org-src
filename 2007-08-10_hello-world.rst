A warm welcome to anyone browsing this website.

The idea of this site came to me when I decided to write down many
experiences I had in science. Many sources are available for science,
the most notable probably being `Wikipedia <http://www.wikipedia.org>`_,
and I'm not really trying to fill a gap. Most of the information you
will find here come either from some other website, or some other
knowledge repository (books, articles, and so on) or from my personal
experience.

As a programmer, I will also write down ideas relative to programming
applied to science, coding ideas and design, but also GUI usability,
tips and tricks and so on. I will provide downloads of my own code
snippets, when possible.

Of course, everything depends on my spare time, which is, quite
expectedly, not really much. I will do as much as I can, mainly because
I like the idea of a website "for the science".
