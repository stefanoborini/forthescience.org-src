The usefulness of drones for beekeeping

Today we talk about drones. Drones are male bees, the result of
unfertilized eggs. As such, they only have 16 chromosomes, instead of
32, a characteristic called haploidy. They are, on all respects, "flying
gametes" and their role in the colony is essentially reproductive. Their
size is larger than the worker bee, and their eyes are larger and all
around the head. In this picture you can see a drone (left) and a worker
bee (right), head to head.

A newborn queen that has not taken its fecundation flight is a "virgin
queen" and can only deposit unfertilized drone eggs. Only during the
nuptial flight the queen reaches the "drone congregation areas" and
mates with multiple drones, storing sperm in her
`spermatheca <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatheca>`_. Interestingly
enough, it's still unclear how these congregation areas are chosen.
`Magnetism might play a role, but it's
unclear <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_(bee)#Drone_Congregation_Areas>`_.
Now the queen can lay either fertilized eggs to produce female worker
bees or unfertilized ones to produce drones. The size of the cell is
what determines if fecundation happens or not, so the workers drive
fertilization through appropriate cell engineering.

Another circumstance when drones are produced in a hive is when workers
are queenless and can't rear a new queen, either because there's no
brood, or because the existing one is too advanced in development. When
this happens, the colony is doomed, and the workers start laying
drone-producing eggs

Observe how the eggs are not at the bottom of the cell, but on its side.
This is because workers have a shorter abdomen than the queen, and can't
reach the bottom easily. When this happens, the general aspect of the
frame screams sadness

This is a frame from a doomed colony. There's very little we could do.
Requeening with a new, bought queen was not going to solve: the colony
was already too weak to sustain itself.

But let's go back to drones. For the beekeeper, the drone is useful for
two tasks: keeping the parasitic mite varroa in check, and as a training
ground for marking. While the second is mostly a gimmick, the first is
essential for a healthy colony.

Keeping the varroa in check
---------------------------

`Varroa is a parasitic
mite <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varroa_destructor>`_ that depends on
the larvae for its life cycle and can completely destroy a hive if left
unchecked. It's a fast-moving, reddish, crab-like mite which falls into
the uncapped brood cells, and gets nourishment and reproductive ground
from the growing larva. Drones are preferred, although as far as I heard
it's not clear if due to pure chance (the mite just falls randomly, and
drones take longer to develop, thus the cells are open for a longer
time) or active seeking for drone cells. This preference is useful to
verify the mite presence and to reduce its load by culling the drones.

A useful trick I recently learned is to divide a frame in the bottom
(brood) super in three parts

This way, it will be developed one section after another, so it's much
easier to observe and monitor larvae development, and time of varroa
introduction. Every week, the section which developed the most will be
removed and checked.

I have not seen any varroa mite here in Denmark, not alive at least. In
Germany they were more present, but their number was still quite low.
It's always worth remembering that the mite population can explode if
left unchecked.

Training exercise for marking
-----------------------------

New beekeepers need to train how to mark the queen. The drone is perfect
for this as it cannot sting

The end result is quite satisfying for a new beekeeper. It's probably
the first time one really touches the insect and start manipulating it.
