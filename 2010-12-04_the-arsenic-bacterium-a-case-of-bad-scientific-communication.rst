As you probably heard in the news, two days ago everyone was ablaze for
a mysterious announcement from NASA. Speculation started on how the new
discovery would "impact the search for evidence of extraterrestrial
life." Someone found a habitable planet? Found a message with Seti@HOME?
Discovered the primordial soup composition? The buzz resonated and
amplified at every new passage, like in a `Chinese
whisperers <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers>`_ game,
speculations were born and distorted, sometimes by the lack of
scientific knowledge of the message carriers, sometimes by a deliberate
"science-fiction twist". Now that the announcement has been made, it's a
big disappointment, a delusion... you name it.

I'd like to propose to make a step back and see the thing from a bit of
distance. Let's analyze the facts. Life (from the tiny bacterium to a
giant whale) generally uses six fundamental elements: Carbon, Hydrogen,
Oxygen, Nitrogen, Sulfur, and Phosphorus. From these six elements, a
large majority of the fundamental building blocks of life are created:
DNA, Acetil CoA (a transporter molecule), ATP (for energy storage) and
many, many others. Yes, some other elements are used, but they are in a
tiny amount, and although this tiny amount is essential for life, it is
really a pinch.

On this planet, life managed to conquer places that are considered
"extreme". There's a class of bacteria called "Extremophiles" which
collects all those living under really unexpected conditions. For
example, there are bacteria living in almost boiling water, or in very
high concentration of acids. The "extreme" conditions are, however, in
the eye of the beholder. For these bacteria, their condition is just the
norm. For us, living in a scorching boiling hot spring, or in a
poisonous acid well is "extreme", as it would be extreme for them to
live at 25 degrees of temperature in a neutral pH. In fact, they are
well adapted to their niche. With the recent rise of techniques for
biological analysis and sequencing, we are exploring more and more of
these niches, and discover more and more bacteria (or communities of
bacteria) well adapted to these niches.

There is a lake in California called `Mono
Lake <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_Lake>`_. It is one of those
extreme places when it comes to conditions: high saline concentration
and alcalinity makes it probably a very unpleasant place to take a bath.
Fishes agree, and quickly give up and die, so the only thing that lives
in that water are some shrimps, algae and bacteria. To complete the nice
picture, it has one of the highest concentration of Arsenic, which is a
poisonous substance to us, and in general to all organisms. As said
before, any bacterium living in extreme conditions for us is classified
as "extremophile". `GFAJ-1 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFAJ-1>`_, the
little bug announced by NASA rightfully belongs to the category, since
it lives in the waters of the Mono Lake.

The bacterium has proven really, really tough with respect to Arsenic
tolerance. Grown in a lab with even higher concentrations of Arsenic and
no Phosphorus at all, the bug decided to switch to Arsenic when it comes
to inclusion in its fundamental components, replacing Phosphorus in DNA,
ATP and so on. In practice, faced with a lack of a really important
element such as Phosphorus, he said "screw that, I'm using Arsenic, it's
good enough for me". This is really a novelty, but it is not
revolutionary. It is just a very important finding, being the first time
where life uses completely unusual strategies to continue thriving.

Summing up, the content of this discovery is:

#. for the first time, a different element (Arsenic) was experimentally
   seen as a substitute for another element (Phosphorus) to build
   fundamental biologically important molecules in-vivo.
#. there's no number 2

Seriously, it's a great finding, but that's what the facts tell us. No
aliens, no totally different life form on earth, no implications for
space research... maybe just a little: we should not be so strict in
assuming Phosphorus as so fundamental for life, given that it can be
successfully replaced. We also should realize how resilient and
adaptable is life when faced with harsh conditions.

Excessive hype and broken dreams
--------------------------------

The `announcement of the conference at
NASA <http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/nov/HQ_M10-167_Astrobiology.html>`_
landslided a serious amount of speculation and hype. Maybe it was
intentional, maybe it was just a mass craze triggered by unintentional
circumstances. I cannot say. What is clear is a good amount of blog
posts
(`1 <http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2010/12/02/mono-lake-bacteria-build-their-dna-using-arsenic-and-no-this-isnt-about-aliens/>`_,

`5 <http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/12/its_not_an_arsenic-based_life.php>`_)
pointed out the excessive hype, and the sheer disappointment that
followed. This in turn fuels news fatigue. As I already `pointed out in
a previous
post <http://forthescience.org/blog/2010/09/13/the-challenges-of-scientific-communication/3/>`_,
this news fatigue in turns fuels misunderstanding, detachment and apathy
towards new discoveries. We all want NASA to tell us: "listen, we got
that call from ET" but seriously, it's not how science normally works.

So what's the correct recipe ? What do you have to do and understand
when you read or hear some scientific news, and how much weight do you
have to apply? In my next post I will tell you simple rules on how to
read scientific news with a critical and realistic eye, directly from my
experience on scientific papers. Stay tuned.

**Edit**: *I decided to postpone the continuation of the article for
now. I already have a draft, but I am quite busy at the moment, and I
have a very long queue of scheduled articles already. I may insert it in
the queue, however.*
