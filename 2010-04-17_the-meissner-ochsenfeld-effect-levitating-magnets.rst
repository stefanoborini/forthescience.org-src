The Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect: levitating magnets

Recently, I had the chance to see a presentation of cool scientific
magic: the `Meissner-Ochsenfeld
effect <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meissner-Ochsenfeld_effect>`_.

What you can see here is a magnet (the yellow-red cylinder) levitating
above a small dish of superconductive material, and consequently free to
spin in mid-air. The superconductor must be kept at liquid nitrogen
temperature (-196 degrees C) to provide this effect, a limitation that
is slowly being removed by research on high-temperature
superconductivity. Due to its complete diamagnetism, the superconductor
completely expels the magnetic field, and pins the magnetic flux lines
around it. I'm not familiar at all with the physics involved in this
phenomenon, but I believe it has one of the strongest "Oooh" factors
ever in terms of popular scientific dissemination. For this reason, I
chose this to be my first YouTube video.
