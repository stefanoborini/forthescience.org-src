I just arrived home from The Amazing Meeting 2010, and I would really
like to report my warm comments on the event, but for practical reasons
I am forced to delay a clearly articulate post. Those who followed
@forthescience on twitter already had an idea of the event, although
reporting with clarity a live situation is always difficult, at least
for me. In the next days, I will start writing more details about the
event; if the posts become excessively long, I will do multiple posts,
separated by some days. I won't do a unique, long post with multiple
pages.

That said, stay tuned, but briefly said... how was the meeting for me ?
On a scale from negative to positive, my overall feeling about the
meeting is neutral with a hint of positive.
