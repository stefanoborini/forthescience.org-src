I just created a new proposal at
`Area51 <http://area51.stackexchange.com>`_:
`Academia <http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/16617/academia>`_.
The aim of such Question/Answers site, when opened, is to provide
assistance to academics of any level and discipline, with particular
focus towards academic life, grants, papers and posters, conferences,
career, management, research group directions, and academic services.

You can `subscribe to the proposal by following this
link <http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/16617/academia?referrer=uVR2liuBPBj7_uTkKsMvLw2>`_
and clicking "follow". You will probably have to login using any OpenID
provider (such as Google mail).
