Google decided to interrupt `further development of
Wave <http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/update-on-google-wave.html>`_.
The service itself remains active, though. I appear not to be good at
predictions: `a year ago, I expected Wave to take over email
definitely <http://forthescience.org/blog/2009/06/04/google-wave-say-goodbye-to-email/>`_.
To be fair, a condition I added was for the server to be made public for
third parties, something that never happened and is not going to happen,
but to be even more fair, if this had happened the result would not have
been different today, I think.

I'm not particularly sad. I subscribed to the beta, and tested Wave as
soon as I got access. After some days of loneliness, some friends were
allowed in, and we started using it for communication and collaborative
writing. Wave is technically amazing, but once you use it for a while,
you realize it's not an email, not a wiki, not a chat. Its main
characteristic is **NOT** to be something, and the final product is
impractical for use on each task.

Despite is intrinsic lack of success, Wave gave me a sound demonstration
of two important facts: that an impressive technical product is not also
a successful consumer product; and that usability of a consumer
end-product comes from specialization for use cases.
