I just started to hold exercises lectures during a `course in
bioinformatics <http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/dtucourse/programme27444.php>`_. I
am publishing the lecture notes while the course goes on. Please note
that the copyright holder is DTU (although my preference goes to a
CreativeCommons license), and that there could be mistakes on the notes,
mainly because I am preparing them in a big rush.
