A convenient tool to embed wax foundation in the frames

This is an interesting and curious self-made tool to embed the wax
foundation in the frames. It consist of a power supply (below the angled
wood panel) and two contact plates at the bottom. The frame is built so
that the wire ends are connected to two small nails, acting as contacts.
Simply by setting the frame, the heat generated by electricity is enough
to melt the wax and embed the sheet in the wires.
