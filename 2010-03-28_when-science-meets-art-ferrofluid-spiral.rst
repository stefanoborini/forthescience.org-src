It is always a pleasure when scientific findings are used for impressive
exhibitions of beauty and harmony. `Sachiko
Kodama <http://www.kodama.hc.uec.ac.jp/index-e.html>`_ is a Japanese
professor and artist who took advantage of new materials to produce an
amazing display of beauty

The `Morpho Spirals <http://www.kodama.hc.uec.ac.jp/spiral/>`_ work by
applying a music-controlled magnetic field to a
`*ferrofluid* <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrofluid>`_, a class of
substances also known as "liquid iron". Many of us probably had the
chance to play with iron filings and a magnet. The result shows the
magnetic field pattern between the two poles of the magnet

`Ferrofluids <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrofluid>`_ are substances
similar to shaving gel, embedded with particles of a
magnetically-reactive (paramagnetic) substance, such as magnetite. The
size of these particles is so tiny that we are well in the realm of
nanotechnology (size in the billionth of a meter), so that the obtained
gel is a stable `colloidal
suspension <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid>`_, where no separation
between the two parts occurs. The result looks and behaves like "liquid
iron", which can be shaped by a magnetic field exactly as the iron
filings we played with as children. Put some Japanese style into it, and
the result is fascinating both artistically and scientifically.
