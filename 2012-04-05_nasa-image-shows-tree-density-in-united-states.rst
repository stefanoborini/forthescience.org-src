This impressive image, released a few months ago, shows the tree density
in the United States

According to the `NASA Earth Observatory
website <http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=76697>`_, the
map has been obtained from a variety of sources, from ground data
collection to space-based radar, requiring 6 years of work. At the
highest resolution, ten pixels correspond to an hectare of land. It
shows how little of the territory is actually covered in trees, either
because of territory constraints (height, climate) or because of
agriculture needs. As I said in a previous post, `trees are fundamental
(and cheap) carbon dioxide
gatherers <http://forthescience.org/blog/2011/11/10/offsetting-carbon-emissions-with-trees-a-little-math/>`_,
but they also tend to require a lot of water and proper climate.
