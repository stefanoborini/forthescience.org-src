Please take a look at this

This technology is probably the future of entertainment. It needs no
batteries, has a nice resolution both for pictures and text, it can be
easily `bookmarked <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmark>`_ or
`annotated <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencil>`_ (although sometimes
there's `not enough
space <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem#Fermat.27s_conjecture>`_).
It can be bought both online and in a shop, brand new or used. `It is
relatively easy to use <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQHX-SjgQvQ>`_.

It has no `Digital Rights
Management <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management>`_,
`it does not force you to read through the
preface <http://www.boingboing.net/2010/05/07/fcc-hands-hollywood.html>`_
if you don't want to, there are no advertisements, you can `read it in
Japan even if you bought it in
Europe <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_lockout>`_, `it does not
disappear by itself if you take a break from reading it, or after you
finished reading
it <http://ipod.about.com/od/itunesmovierentals/f/rentals_expires.htm>`_.
You can re-read it every time you want without having to pay more, `it
does not allow the editor to enter illegally into your apartment to
check if you are a good
citizen <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_rootkit>`_ (and leaving the
door open to others), you don't have to `buy authorized glasses and
lightbulbs to read
it <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_restrictions>`_. It `does not
call the editor back every time you open
it <http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/98927-Ubisoft-DRM-Authentication-Servers-Go-Down>`_,
and `you can still read it if the editor goes
bankrupt <http://www.cepro.com/article/what_happens_to_your_digital_content_if_the_provider_goes_out_of_business/>`_.

It is cheap, made of pure 100 % recyclable support, and collectible to
please all your hoarding needs. It is totally backward compatible, and
there's a `huge collections of titles already available for
fruition <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_congress>`_. You can
borrow or lend it, give it to your friends or leave it to your children,
and `it will still be
accessible <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_obsolescence>`_. There
are `places where it can be obtained and accessed for
free <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_library>`_ or `exchanged in a
peer-to-peer way <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_swapping>`_ without
`infringing the
law <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement>`_.

I firmly believe this technology is the future of entertainment and
dissemination of knowledge.
