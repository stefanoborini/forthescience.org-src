MacOSX Leopard and freezing keyboard

Looks like I am not the only one suffering of keyboard freezes in
`MacOSX Leopard <http://www.google.com/search?q=macosx+leopard+keyboard+freeze>`_
on a laptop. Looks like upgrading to 10.5.1 does not solve either. A
temporary solution for this problem, while waiting for Apple to release
a patch, is to keep numlock pressed for some seconds. When the led turns
on, the keyboard is alive again. At least, it works for me.
