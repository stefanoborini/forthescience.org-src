The synthesis of urea is a fascinating and critical event. It sent a
shocking quake through many open questions in chemistry, and answered
them with a cold hard fact with no chance of misunderstanding. It slain
one theory,
`vitalism <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism#Foundations_of_chemistry>`_,
and was in front line to promote the discipline of "organic chemistry",
the chemistry of carbon compounds.

Since the discovery of fire, a useful taxonomy of substances was "those
which burn" versus "those which melt". The freezing caveman probably
learned rather quickly to bring wood instead of rocks in his cave. Two
important additional observation that involved chemists and philosophers
alike were that everything that burned came from living creatures, and
everything that burned could not be restored to its original form once
the heat source was removed. Today, we know they decompose, but at that
time, the main doctrine was that heat forever removed some special
substance, a "vital force", whose intrinsic characteristic was to grant
life and life-related behavior. The vitalistic theory was clear: you
could get from vital matter to non-vital matter, but you could never do
the opposite, i.e. create vital force from nothing. Vital, organic
substances could only be created by the living bodies of animals and
plants.

**`Wöhler <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_W%C3%B6hler>`_, a
german chemist born in 1800, was the man who destroyed with a single
blow the vital force theory**. By synthesizing urea from inorganic
compounds, he demonstrated that something found and produced by a living
organism could be obtained in the laboratory from a non-living chemical
compound, ammonium cyanate. There was no need for a mysterious vital
force supposedly present in living plants and animals to generate
organic compounds. Both living and non-living matter obeyed to the same
rules: those of chemistry. In Wöhler words, what he achieved was "the
great tragedy of science, the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an
ugly fact." And facts are what scientists believe in.

Urea was first isolated from human urine by a French chemist, Hillaire
Rouelle, in 1773. Our body (and those of other mammals) produces urea
from the metabolism of proteins, with a process called `Urea
cycle <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea_cycle>`_, elucidated only 150
years later by Krebs and Henseleit. In mammals, this process is
performed in the liver, which breaks down proteins (obtained from a nice
steak, for example) into its components, the amino acids. Some of them
are recycled as-is, to build more proteins for our body, while the
excess ones are eliminated. Amino acids contains nitrogen atoms, and an
efficient strategy to purge them has been evolved by relocating them
into the formation of urea, a strategy with many advantages: urea is
inert, very soluble and contains a lot of nitrogen, making it an ideal
and efficient carrier for translocation and elimination.

Another issue troubling chemists contemporary to Wöhler, and Wöhler
himself, was that substances with the same constituent atoms could have
different properties. Bear in mind that we are talking of the early days
of laboratory chemistry, and chemical formulas were evaluated by burning
stuff and measuring the obtained products: CO2 from carbons, water from
hydrogens. Nitrogen could be determined by converting it to ammonia, and
oxygen was assumed to fill up the missing difference. As you can
imagine, it was error-prone at best. Nevertheless, accurate molecular
formulas could be obtained, and first instances of completely different
compounds with the same molecular formula started to appear, cases of
what we know today as **isomerism**: different arrangements of the same
atoms bring different properties. Take ethanol and ether as an example:
you can drink the first and have a good time, but the second is going to
be a very, very bad experience. Both have the same molecular formula:
C2H6O. Synthesis of urea from ammonium cyanate
`The Wohler synthesis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wohler_synthesis.gif>`_ was
another instance of a transformation involving isomerism. Both had the
same molecular formula, but different properties. In this sense, Wohler
actually achieved two feats in one shot: disproved vitalism, and
provided rock solid evidence for isomerism.

As you can see from these findings, Wöhler was a remarkable and
proficient chemist. In addition to urea synthesis, he is also known for
isolating, discovering or characterizing both natural compounds
(benzaldehyde, uric acid) and inorganic metals (aluminium, beryllium,
yttrium, silicon, nickel, cobalt). He had a very interesting and
polihedric personality: calm and patient, focused on facts rather than
speculation, avid collector of meteorites and roman anquities,
interested in chemistry, mathematics, arts, history.

Today, Urea is produced from ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in a
high pressure, high temperature reactor. This mixture produces ammonium
carbamate (NH2COONH4). Removing a molecule of water from this salt
produces urea, which is then "prilled" (solidified into granules) by
spraying it from the top of a very high tower (the so-called "prilling
tower"). Urea is incredibly central in our modern life: it is an optimal
fertilizer, due to its high concentration of nitrogen. It slowly
releases two ammonia molecules and CO2, allowing a gradual release of
nitrogen which is then fixed by soil bacteria and made available to the
plant. With malonic acid, it forms barbituric acid, a base for
pharmaceutical compounds. Production of melamine/urea-formaldehyde
resins allows production of glues and other plastics.

Wöhler findings were just the beginning of a series of discoveries and
realizations in organic chemistry, whose legacy is still pervasive
today. It stimulated major advancements in biochemistry, inorganic
chemistry, spectroscopy, theoretical chemistry, and analytical
chemistry.
