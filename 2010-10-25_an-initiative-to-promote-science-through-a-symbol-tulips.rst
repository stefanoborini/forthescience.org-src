After I came back from TAM 2010, I was waiting for my train to bring me
home. I started thinking that there is a potential Public Relations
issue with scientific proponents and skeptics around, and it's never
good to have a Public Relations issue. I feel there's a need to change
this, and a need to do good to promote critical thinking and scientific
research, raise awareness about science while promoting well being.

The stream of thoughts focused me to the following needs:

#. Reduce the perceived vision of "dicks" and instead promote an image
   of carefulness, long term planning, passion and love for beauty
#. Do some activity requiring small expertise, promoting a gratifying,
   beautiful result
#. Do some activity whose apex is during a relatively narrow period of
   time, so that there's a particular period of the year where things
   happen and people see the result
#. Something symbolic must be used. The symbol must be nice, and
   increase the level of happiness. A symbol that uses nature, and
   focuses on growth through human contribution
#. Some good, concrete action must be done as a concurrent activity
#. It must act as a constant reminder of your commitment
#. It must influence the life of others, without bragging about how good
   and kind you are, because bragging may be perceived as impolite

After a while, I decided to go with the following

Yep, that's a bag of tulip bulbs. Cheap, and full of beauty.

Once a year I receive the royalties from the book I published together
with other, much greater than me people. I decided to put these money to
a more productive goal than buying a new hard drive, and I donated them:
Wikipedia and Doctors Without Borders. (yep, sorry I have to brag just
for the argument)

After my train of thoughts, this year I decided to associate this
donation to gardening. I've never grown anything in my own life, and I
have nobody around able to give me hints, so it's definitely a challenge
for me. The idea works like this: I plant the tulip bulbs in October.
When in Spring I get a nice tulip, I donate the flower to a person I
know, and at the same time I donate to a science-oriented no-profit
organization.

Do you want to follow me in this idea? good. Here are the general rules:

#. Plant the tulips. Here are
   `instructions <http://www.ehow.com/how_2292686_grow-tulips.html>`_
   and some
   `Q/A <http://www.ext.nodak.edu/extnews/hortiscope/flowers/tulip.htm>`_.
   They must be put into a vase during the Fall (that is, now, if you
   live in the northern hemisphere), and stay outside in a sunny, dry
   place.
#. Send me an email or twitter message to inform me you planted a bulb.
   My email is in the About Me page.
#. Tulips bloom in Spring. If you are a geek, you can try with a time
   lapse of the growth, but it's enough if you take a picture of the
   flower in its vase. After this, either cut or move the flower in a
   small vase. Give the flower to a person you know, and don't tell
   him/her what's about. The point is to make someone happy with a
   simple act of kindness. If him/her is interested to know more about
   what's going on, he/she will find out. You have to know the person
   because giving something to strangers for no reason is likely to make
   them uncomfortable, rather than happy. Go for someone who trusts you.
#. Donate something for correct scientific dissemination, critical
   thinking, health care, environment protection and cleanup, or
   anything else that improves quality of life through good science and
   encourages love for science and the scientific method. Your choice.
   It could be money, it could be some relevant amount of your time. If
   you choose to donate, choose a non-profit that promotes science. For
   example, in Italy there's `Telethon for muscular
   dystrophy <http://www.telethon.it/Pagine/Home.aspx>`_, but you can
   also go for cancer research and assistance (like `Cancer Research
   UK <http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/>`_, for example), STD
   prevention... your call. Try, if possible, to promote organizations
   or activities based in your own country.
#. Send me the picture of the flower. If the idea catches on, I will try
   to organize a website to publish the pictures.

Why a tulip you may ask? I'm in the Netherlands, tulips are beautiful,
simple, easy to grow, and it's the right period of the year. It seems a
natural choice.

Have fun!
