Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) is a class of compounds, the simplest among
them with a structure similar to the one of methane: a tetrahedron. A
simple representative is the one pictured below,
Dichlorodifluoromethane. It's a molecule made of one carbon atom (in the
center, black), two chlorine atoms (on top, green) and two fluorine
atoms (on bottom, pea green).

The class includes slightly more complex molecules, but all of them have
one thing in common: they are made of carbon, chlorine and fluorine (and
occasionally, hydrogen). In this post, we will briefly examine the
history of CFC compounds, why they were so disruptive at the time, why
they turned out to be so dangerous, and why their contribute to human
knowledge was a strong wake-up call for everybody on this little blue
planet.

Why CFCs? A brief history of making cold
----------------------------------------

Just out of the trees and into the caves, humanity learned how to make
heat. Controlling fire was maybe the first important technological
advancement of humanity, as it improved quality of food (cooked meat is
easier to eat and digest, and cooking kills parasites), safety
(dangerous animals don't like fire) and health by warming the cold,
humid cave. It took a very low initial technological level to heat
things, for a very valid reason: making heat is easily done because the
chemical reaction between organic matter and oxygen (that is, burning)
is relatively easy to start, produces a lot of heat, and requires
components that are easy to find. The opposite operation, cooling, took
much longer and way more advanced knowledge.

`|Ice
man| <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-47890-0001,_Berlin,_Kinder_mit_dem_Eismann.jpg>`_Before
the invention of refrigerators there were basically three techniques to
cool down things, typically for preservation purposes. The first
technique was storing ice and snow in `ice
houses <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_house_%28building%29>`_ during
winter. Good insulation and the mass of accumulated snow allowed to keep
low temperatures during the warm months. Later in time, services were
built around the need for cold, `cutting and transporting ice
blocks <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cutting>`_ from cold regions to
service warm ones. People `went around in carts selling ice
blocks <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceman_%28occupation%29>`_,
typically giving small chunks of ice to children to have fun with. Your
parents may recall being among these children. The blocks of ice were
put into `ice boxes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icebox>`_, together
with perishables.

Another solution to make cold was mixing common salt and snow, to create
a `frigorific
mixture <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigorific_mixture>`_ due to its
`eutectic properties <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutectic_system>`_.
With this technique, temperatures as low as -21 degrees Celsius can be
obtained with ease. The same property is used to melt snow in winter.
Similar to the previous option, it requires to have solid water to begin
with.

Finally, a third option was to dissolve in water some very specific
salts, such as sodium, potassium or ammonium nitrate. These salts
require heat to dissolve, subtracting it from the environment (the
dissolution is said to be endothermic, in opposition to exothermic ones
which produce heat). This concept is successfully used in `instant cold
packs <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_cold_pack>`_ you may find at
your local sport shop. This option has two advantages, namely that it
does not require something already cold to operate, and that the salt
can be restored and reused by evaporating the water.

With a better understanding of thermodynamics and the state of matter,
at the beginning of the 19th century the knowledge was available to
develop better technology for the production of cold. Through a proper
strategy of expansions and compression of well-chosen gases, efficient
removal of heat was both feasible and practical, first industrially,
then at the consumer level. When the first refrigerators arrived on the
market, the choices for the exchange gas was limited to
`ammonia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia>`_ (highly toxic),
`sulfur dioxide <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide>`_ (also
toxic if inhaled in large quantities), and
`chloromethane <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloromethane>`_ (toxic and
flammable). Needless to say, leaks occurred, people died, and the
general public preferred the old "big ice cube in a box" solution, or
they kept the refrigerator outside, where an eventual leak would pose no
immediate danger. A better solution was needed.

In 1929 `Thomas Midgley,
Jr <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley,_Jr.>`_. and `Charles
Franklin Kettering <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_F._Kettering>`_
teamed together to tackle the problem, and they found a good solution in
CFCs, unaware of the environmental danger of their discovery.
Incidentally, from the efforts of these two guys also came out the
gasoline additive `tetraethyl
lead <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead>`_, another very
troublesome compound. It appears they had a special sense for stumbling
on ecologically devastating stuff.

In addition to refrigeration, CFCs were found useful for other tasks,
such as propellants for aerosols, solvents, and fire fighting equipment.
Their stable, inert and non-toxic properties were just perfect, or so it
appeared.

The ozone cycle
---------------

To understand why CFCs are so dangerous, we first need to know the role
of ozone in upper atmosphere. In normal conditions, ozone is a gas made
of three oxygen atoms, O\ :sub:`3`\ .

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="120"
caption="Ozone"]`|Ozone| <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ozone-CRC-MW-3D-balls.png>`_[/caption]

In comparison, the "conventional oxygen" we breathe is a molecule made
of just two atoms bonded together, O\ :sub:`2`\ . Ozone has a
characteristic smell we normally call "the smell of electricity", being
generated in appreciable quantities by electrical discharges. At ground
level is a dangerous pollutant, because it's highly reactive and
irritant, but in upper atmosphere is our shield against the intense and
carcinogenic ultraviolet radiation emitted by the Sun.

Ozone is produced through a very slow process from molecular oxygen. The
molecule is smashed into individual atoms by the Sun UV radiations

O\ :sub:`2`\  + UV radiation -> 2 O

and each of these oxygen atoms may attach to other oxygen molecules to
form ozone

O\ :sub:`2`\  + O -> O\ :sub:`3`\ 

a reaction that releases heat via intermediary species. Ozone can now
adsorb further UV radiation to split back again

O\ :sub:`3`\  + UV radiation -> O\ :sub:`2`\  + O

and start the cycle again. The net effect is the one of a
`catalyzer <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalyzer>`_, a substance that
eases an interconversion (in this case of dangerous UV radiation into
heat) without being depleted, as would be a reactant. Instead, a
catalyzer is restored in its active state once the interconversion is
over, and it is ready to operate again. Please note: a minimal amount of
catalyzer is able to promote a huge amount of interconversions.

Thanks to this chemistry, ozone degrades large quantities of dangerous
UV radiations into innocuous heat, in a cycle known as the `Ozone-Oxygen
cycle <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone-oxygen_cycle>`_.

`|image3| <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ozone_cycle.svg>`_

In normal conditions, there are other two important reactions that can
occur. Both destroy ozone and restore molecular oxygen

O\ :sub:`3`\  + O -> 2 O\ :sub:`2`\ 

2 O -> O\ :sub:`2`\ 

All the reactions given above (creation, catalysis, and destruction,
among many others) constantly happen in upper atmosphere. Their final
balance leads to an equilibrium of a relatively stable concentration of
ozone, dependent on solar irradiation, which in turn depends on seasons,
latitude and solar activity.

How CFC disrupt the ozone cycle
-------------------------------

Where do CFC enter in the game? It turns out that the biggest advantage
of CFCs, their stability, is also their first major problem. CFCs are
heavier than air (and thus tend to sink) `but this is not preventing
them to reach the upper
atmosphere <http://www.epa.gov/ozone/science/myths/heavier.html>`_,
helped by their long life. Diffusion and winds mix up the atmosphere
constantly, creating a relevant concentration of CFCs in upper
atmosphere. Once there, the second major problem arises: when hit by UV
radiations, CFCs release a chlorine atom:

CCl\ :sub:`3`\ F + UV radiation -> CCl\ :sub:`2`\ F\ :sup:`**.**`\  +
Cl\ :sup:`**.**`\ 

The chlorine atom has a lone electron, and in this configuration is
highly reactive and combines with ozone, operating as a catalyzer for
the ozone distruction. The reactions are complex and numerous (if you
want all the gory details, `this online book is a
start <http://www.ccpo.odu.edu/~lizsmith/SEES/ozone/oz_class.htm>`_),
but the net effect is a reduction of ozone and the creation of molecular
oxygen. Remember, a catalyzer emerges unscathed from the reaction it
promotes, meaning that a minimal amount of chlorine can promote the
destruction of large quantities of ozone, unbalancing the equilibrium
previously compensated by the slow reaction of creation O\ :sub:`2`\  +
UV -> 2 O. The shielding of UV radiation becomes less and less
effective, on par with the decreasing concentration of ozone, and the
radiation can now reach the surface.

A swift action is called for: the Montreal protocol
---------------------------------------------------

We owe to `James
Lovelock <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lovelock>`_, `Frank
Rowland <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherry_Rowland>`_ and `Mario
Molina <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Molina>`_, among many others
if our eyes were open to a dramatic trend. During the 70s, it became
clear to the scientific community that CFC were a source of trouble.
Confirmation came in the 80s, where incredibly low concentrations of
ozone were found over the south polar region, a "ozone hole" of
unquestionable evidence.

The `Vienna
Convention <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_the_Ozone_Layer>`_
and the `Montreal
Protocol <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol>`_, enforced on
the 1st of January 1989, defined an impressive and immediate worldwide
response to the problem, suppressing industrial production and use of
CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances. Without this ban, the result
would be the one simulated by NASA

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="400" caption="Ozone layer
simulation by
NASA"]`|image4| <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Future_ozone_layer_concentrations.jpg>`_[/caption]

Total destruction of the ozone layer, with no chance of recovery, before
2060. NASA also released a movie of the simulation, compared side by
side with the projected situation we expect with the ban enforced. You
can find it at `the NASA page for the
simulation <http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/world_avoided.html>`_,
or at `this YouTube
movie <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqYJWXCTbmU>`_. Without ozone
layer, the amount of UV radiation reaching the surface would be so high
to cause sunburns in minutes, and occurrences of skin cancer would have
soared globally. These, of course, would be just the direct effects on
humans. The rest of the biosphere would have had an unpleasant situation
as well.

CFCs have been banned from almost any application, from refrigeration to
`pharmaceutical
nebulizers <http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugSafetyPodcasts/ucm076979.htm>`_.
Some temporary, highly scrutinized exceptions have been defined for
those applications where no substitute could be found, such as some fire
extinction strategies. The general idea is to use compounds which `are
either degraded before reaching upper atmosphere, or that don't contain
chlorine or bromine atoms <http://www.ciesin.org/TG/OZ/odp.html>`_,
therefore having a `reduced impact on the ozone
layer <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion_potential>`_. Common
substitutes today are `R134a <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R134a>`_ (a
fluoroethane, also being phased out) and
`R600a <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isobutane>`_ (isobutane, much safer
for the environment but highly flammable). There are also strict
regulations in force, concerning maintenance, recovery and recycling of
currently existing CFC (see, for example, `here at US
EPA <http://www.epa.gov/ozone/title6/608/608fact.html>`_). Although the
dangers have been avoided, the legacy of CFCs usage `will linger for at
least one hundred
years <http://www.livescience.com/9899-happened-hole-ozone-layer.html>`_.

The aftermath of a potential catastrophe
----------------------------------------

The Montreal protocol and the avoided catastrophe of ozone depletion
have been a huge wake up call for humanity. We realized that our planet
has a fragile ecosystem, whose complexity and interdependency is broad
and still to be discovered. As humans, we owe us a big pat on the back,
but there are still troubles ahead: global warming, oil depletion,
overpopulation. It's time we stop wasting time, because swift actions
are needed again. With Montreal, we demonstrated that humanity can
achieve a common goal and solve a common problem. We need strong
leaders, iron-clad reason, proper actions and global effort to face the
common goals and problems of tomorrow. We have only one planet, this
one:
