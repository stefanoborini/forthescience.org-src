Imagine you are a professor in organic chemistry. You received financial
support for a project, and you are ready to hire a Ph.D. student to make
it happen. The project requires the synthesis of a new compound.

Imagine you interview your best candidate. At the whiteboard, you
present him with various problems of how to synthesize different
products, and you find he is very qualified in planning these
strategies. He also knows how to estimate the yields of the products,
and how much initial reagents are needed. He knows temperatures and
catalyzers required, as well as conditions that may break down the
product. He can also write excellent articles. Seems a very promising
person, so you hire him.

After a few weeks, he joins the group and enters your lab for the first
time. Here you find out the following about him:

-  It is the first, maybe second time he enters into a lab.
-  He does not know the names of lab glassware. He never heard terms
   like "flask" or "test tube". He actually looks at you with a strange
   face when presented with them, and say that the only time he did an
   experiment during his course, he used a pan and it was enough.
-  He is unable to keep his bench and glassware clean, and most often
   than not, he throws away used glassware instead of washing it.
-  He constantly breaks glassware, scattering glass and reagents around,
   damaging the work of his colleagues who have to clean his mess or
   just deal with it in the most improbable ways.
-  He is unable to assemble glassware (such as he is unable to build a
   distillation setup). He puts clamps in the wrong way, does not put
   silicone grease in the joints, nor any clamp to keep these joins
   sealed to prevent "popping" due to pressure buildup.
-  He never performed a chromatography, nor an Infrared Spectrum. He
   just vaguely heard about them, but his course professor said that
   they are useless and you can identify the substance with a sniff,
   which is enough most of the time.
-  He pretends to prepare and use his own very impure reagents, even
   when high-purity, standard reagents are available from a reagent
   reseller. He claims that it takes too much time to call them and make
   the order. Also, he is unable to understand the codes and numbers
   written on the bottle's label.
-  He labels his flasks with cryptic names, and pass them to colleagues
   who constantly have to ask him what they contain. Most often, he does
   not remember and have to check on his notebook. When he remembers, it
   turns out that the product inside is either polluted or damaged.
-  He disposes of his byproducts in the drain, instead of using the
   proper disposal units. When addressed about it, he says "who cares?
   it takes less trouble"
-  When asked about his low quality work, he claims that it's not his
   task nor its core expertise to produce top quality laboratory work,
   nor to know how to use laboratory equipment, as long as he can manage
   to get the required product at the end. He also points you at a very
   efficient synthetic strategy he just devised at the whiteboard,
   claiming that he is doing an excellent work.
-  At the end of his employment, he leaves a notebook containing the
   process to create the product. The notebook is completely
   disorganized, the pages are mixed and not numbered. The handwriting
   is close to impossible to understand, it is written in four different
   languages, and the quantities are specified as "a pinch of". However,
   the glassware setup he made and left, when fed with the contents of
   an unlabeled reagent bottle you find in a bench downstairs, gives you
   the product, but only if the humidity in the laboratory is at exactly
   75 %.

My question for you, the professor of the group is the following: would
you keep this person in your group, or would you dismiss him?

Same story, different chemist
-----------------------------

The scenario presented above is considered the norm in a different
branch of chemistry, theoretical and computational chemistry. While
"white coat" chemists use whiteboard synthesis strategies, a laboratory,
glassware tools, spectroscopic instruments, chromatography and
distillations, theoretical and computational chemists use mathematics,
computers, editors and software development. Both these sets are tools
for the job, and in order to practice the discipline, proficiency with
them is expected. Yet, in the discipline of theoretical and
computational chemistry, the general level of competence and proficiency
with its tools can be rightfully compared one-to-one with the scenario
given above for the case of organic chemistry.

Organic chemists are supposed to be able to use a laboratory environment
with high quality standards and protocols. By analogy, computational
chemists are supposed to be able to use a software development
environment to high quality standards and protocols. In both cases, to
perform their research they should be required to be masters of the
basic tools, and proficient in a broad set of specialized and modern
tools. It is inexcusable not to be.
