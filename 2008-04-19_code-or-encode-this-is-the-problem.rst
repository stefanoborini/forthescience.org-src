Code or encode? This is the problem.

I am doing proofreading of a textbook and I spotted a quite frequent use
of the term "protein-encoding genes". I reported it as an error,
preferring "protein-coding genes".

Why? There is a strong difference between the two words:

-  to **encode** means to perform an operation that transform some
   information from one representational form to another. Something that
   is performing the act of encoding is, for example, an encrypter, or a
   compressor.
-  to **code** means to express information through a proper standard
   representation.

Saying "protein-encoding genes" literally means that the gene is an
entity performing encoding on the proteins, that is, transforming a
protein from one representational form to another. Saying instead
"protein-coding genes" literally means that the gene expresses
information relative to a protein, which is the correct one.

We could eventually say that the *ribosome* is performing **decoding**
on a mRNA strand to transform its representation of information into a
protein, assuming that in the Central Dogma picture, the DNA is the
encoded information, and the protein is the decoded one.

Despite this, it looks like many biologists use this wrong wording as
standard nomenclature. On Google, searching for `"protein-coding
genes" <http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22protein-coding+genes%22&btnG=Google+Search>`_
reports 442,000 results, while searching `"protein-encoding
genes" <http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22protein-encoding+genes%22&btnG=Search>`_
reports 56,000 results, fewer, but still relevant.
