Those of you old enough to get internet connection with an empty can of
beans connected to a string will probably remembered a coal-powered tool
of the time, the modem. Its shrieks filled the beginning of an evening
of bad GIFs, short web pages with <blink> tags, and plenty of telnet and
IRC sessions. The memorable combination of sounds was a bit of a mystery
to me, but I found this `extremely interesting blog post detailing the

spectrogram <http://windytan.blogspot.fi/2012/11/the-sound-of-dialup-pictured.html>`_.
Worth checking out if you ever wondered what your modem was saying.
