Yesterday around 14.30 a big quake hit the Sendai area in Japan,
followed by a tsunami and a contiguous stream of additional shocks. I
immediately contacted friends in Tokyo and they are all fine.
Transportation in Tokyo is interrupted, and so is communication. I don't
know any more details. I just have news from a friend.

Tokyo and the whole of Japan lays in the so called `pacific ring of
fire <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ring_of_Fire>`_, an area of
violent seismic and vulcanic activity due to the pacific tectonic plate
subducting with the continental plates on the american and asian sides.
The very existence of Japan is due to this subduction, creating the
arched set of islands as a consequence of the arising volcanic activity.
Tokyo, with a grand total population of 30 millions in the metropolitan
area, sits `right on a triple trench
junction <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boso_Triple_Junction>`_,
basically a ticking bomb with an historical average timer of approx. 100
years. Unfortunately this quake is unlikely to reset the timer. The
Tokai zone, where this triple junction develops, is further South. Japan
as a whole sits on a subduction-powered ticking bomb, and you are
reminded often about it. In the year I spent in Tokyo, I experienced a
dozen quakes strong enough to be felt.

I could have been there now if I continued my employment at NII. Words
fail me. It's a place I called home for a year, a place I learned to
know somehow, and now it has changed completely. Places I visited are
now under water, and landmarks I used to see every day are scarred. I am
deeply, deeply sad. I know that the people of Japan will shrug this
tragedy away with their restless efficiency and poised philosophy, and I
wish them all the best.

My final remark wants to remember that it is due to the Japanese
productivity and dedication, the advanced planning and organization, the
technological level of engineering and the compliance to building
regulation that hundred of thousands of lives were saved today.
Engineers and builders are the real heroes in this catastrophe, years
before it struck. Hands that do are those which make life better.

They need your help. The situation is getting worse and worse.
