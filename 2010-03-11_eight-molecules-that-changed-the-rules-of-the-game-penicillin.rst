**Rule changed: the very first antibiotic compound**
----------------------------------------------------

Penicillin. This is definitely one molecule that conquered the
territories of the grim reaper.

Before Penicillin, a minor wound infection could mean a gangrene
(followed by amputation), death, or all of them if you were particularly
unlucky. People used to die for minor skin scratches. Falling, handling
a rose, sewing, were all potentially deadly activities. Many other
diseases we now solve with a couple of pills were a death sentence
before the '40s.

The effects of some molds as healing agents was known since the middle
ages. Saddles were kept in conditions to promote mold formation, because
it was common lore that scratches on horses recovered better when a
moldy saddle was used. It was however only in 1897 that a young French
physician, `Ernest
Duchesne <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Duchesne>`_, observed and
formally tested antibiotic effects of molds, performing formal trials
during his doctoral work. Experiments confirmed his findings, but his
young age and military involvement prevented him to establish the
findings as relevant to the scientific community.

Fast forward 20 years. Andre Gratia and Sarah Dath observed in the 20's
that molds of Penicilliumin inhibited growth of certain bacteria. They
made a paper who received little to no attention, and they pursued
different research directions.

Time passes again. It is 1929, and `Alexander
Fleming <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fleming>`_ is annoyed by
the contamination produced by airborne molds on his Petri dishes of
Staphylococci. He was rather untidy researcher, but apparently it paid
off, since his lack of proper care lead him to the discovery of
`lysozyme <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysozyme>`_ (actually, a
rediscovery. Laschtschenko characterized it 13 years earlier). Thanks to
his previous experience with productive mistakes, he noticed that where
the mold was growing the bacteria were unable to survive. The mold
turned out to be part of the genus
`Penicillium <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillium>`_

After some more experiments, helped by colleagues, Fleming isolated the
substance related to the antibacterial effect (also using his previous
experience with Lysozyme) and publishes his results, but it was no
breakthrough. Fleming was not particularly excited over his discovery,
and continued working on other projects basically forgetting about it.
In fact, there were some considerable issues of primary importance to
solve:

-  The amount of active component was small, too limited to be
   profitable for the industry and functional on humans. The production
   of amounts with therapeutic effect would have required huge
   quantities of mold, and growing it was very difficult.
-  Penicillin is chemically very fragile. It works on a Petri dish and
   in guinea pigs, but there was no guarantee it could stay active in
   sufficient quantity to deliver antibacterial effects in humans.
-  Penicillin had to be injected, and the body eliminates it in urine
   after a few hours. To keep its concentration high enough to kill
   bacteria, attempts were made to recover it from the patient's urine
   and re-inject it, but even then the amount was not sufficient in most
   cases.

As the Second World War was approaching, there was strong demand for
substances showing antibiotic properties. The only available drug on
this respect was
`Prontosil <http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=19325>`_,
but it wasn't well received both because of side-effects and because of
low commercial payback (it was already off-patent). Thanks to the effort
and determination of Howard Florey, Ernst Chain, and Edward Abraham,
production of Penicillin moved from laboratories in Britain to the
United States, where an initial mold strain obtained from a cantaloupe
was optimized by progressive selection to produce huge amounts of active
component.

Chemically, Penicillin is a beta lactam, a cyclic compound with a
characteristic square core. The particular shape of the molecule blocks
the enzyme
`transpeptidase <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DD-transpeptidase>`_,
whose role is to tighten the knots of the molecular net that keeps the
bacterium whole: the cell wall. During bacterial growth, and in
particular at the end of duplication, a consistent section of the wall
is created. With a broken transpeptidase this step is no longer
possible: the bacterium is, so to say, unable to duplicate, and the
infection cannot spread further.

Penicillin triggered extensive research on antibiotic drugs and the
pharmacological research as we know today. In particular, bacteria
evolve methodologies to fight the action of drugs, at the limit of
becoming completely unaffected, hence new strategies and substances must
be developed, tested, and released for public usage.
