How to stop a beam of protons traveling at 99.99 % of the speed of light
and able to melt 500 kg of copper in less than a second ?

I've found `this interesting
article <http://spectrum.ieee.org/print/6558>`_ about how to dispose of
the proton beam from the Large Hadron Collider. The amount of energy and
the focus of the beam is so strong that any metal would melt. So they
use graphite, a solid block of it, 8 meters long and almost one meter
large, weighting almost 10 tons. Graphite has a very high melting
temperature, making it a good choice for the task. Any other solution
would either melt or instantly vaporize, leading to a catastrophic
explosion.

As a consequence, the human head is not supposed to be used for the
task. Despite this, a dramatic accident happened to `Anatoli
Bugorski <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoli_Bugorski>`_, who happened
to stick his head into a particle accelerator beam in 1978, and survived
to tell the tale.
