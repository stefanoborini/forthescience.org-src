The next step (after managing to get out of minecraft) is to install
some other fundamental software I can need. Here is a quick list of the
little things that make the Linux box jump out of the home appliance/NAS
realm and get into serious business.

Git
~~~

As a developer, I find git extremely useful. Additionally, I keep some
important configuration files on github, so it makes sense to install
git. From the ubuntu software center is just a couple of clicks away.

Vim
~~~

To install vim, I go again through the software center. I also download
`my vim configuration files from
github <https://github.com/stefanoborini/vimrc>`_.

XBMC
~~~~

XBMC was easy to install via the ubuntu software center. The software is
extremely good, and I found it packed with plugins to get easily on
youtube. It's a bit disappointing the presentation and access to the
movies (just a directory, I would have preferred a set of scrolling
screenshots of each movie, but maybe I am using it wrong). Overall, I am
extremely satisfied of XBMC. Premium quality software indeed.

I installed a lot of plugins, allowing me to watch euronews, browse my
pictures, and listen to my favorite songs and radio. XBMC is definitely
recommended, its only problems are the tendency to get stuck once in a
while (nothing a ssh+kill can't fix), the abundance of broken plugins
that I had to fix by hand (but they are in python, so it's easy) and a
general tendency to be reliant on mouse action and the right button
click.

Chrome
~~~~~~

Chrome was obtained from the google website as a .deb. Once downloaded,
clicking the package brings the package manager up, and provides an easy
installation step. I am a bit disappointed with the overall quality of
the fonts for the browser.

Stellarium
~~~~~~~~~~

A great planetarium program. A toy for most people, but I find extremely
beautiful to browse the current nightsky and the artificial satellites
moving above my head from my comfy chair.

Psensor
~~~~~~~

Useful to monitor the temperature of my processors. I posted a lot of
diagrams on this regard, and I keep monitoring the temperature during
intensive tasks, as I want to be sure the hardware does not suffer in
its current enclosure.
