I found a `very interesting
commentary <http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/20569/>`_ by Nick
Bostrom, about the existence of extraterrestrial life and the so-called
`Fermi Paradox <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox>`_.
The point Nick Bostrom presents is sensible: the current evidence is
that life is apparently not very frequent in the Universe. Despite all
efforts we did toward finding life, intelligent or not, we failed.
Moreover, the human progression went from very low technology to space
exploration in 10.000 years, a blink of an eye on the Universe time
scale. There are pieces of our civilization travelling out there: the
`Pioneer 10 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_10>`_, the `two
Voyager <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program>`_ and much more.
In two or three hundreds years, we could be able to manipulate matter so
to create self-assembling space probes to scout the galaxy, the `Von
Neumann probes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_Probe>`_. If an
intelligent civilization exists or existed in the galaxy, we would be
surrounded by Von Neumann probes, or at least we would be able to
receive some kind of signal, but this does not happen. Apparently, there
has to be a filtering event that prevents human-intelligent life to
reach a status where galaxy colonization could be started and self
maintained without further intervention.

This filtering event could be before our time, or in front of us. If the
filtering is before our time, it must act as a showstopper for the
development of life forms, meaning that life is rare, potentially unique
even on a universe scale.

However, if we happen to find extraterrestrial life, for example on
Mars, it would mean that the conditions to form life are rather loose.
Life formation is not at all uncommon, and we could expect to find it on
any exoplanet with the right conditions, potentially a huge amount in
the galaxy. Therefore, to address the experimental evidence of no space
colonization despite the billion of years of time passed since the
boot-up of the Universe, we are forced to theorize that in this case the
filtering event is in front of us: mass extinctions already happened in
the past. Could it happen for humanity as well? Under this perspective,
Nick Bostrom states that finding no evidence of life on Mars is a good
news, as this means that the Great Filter was behind of us, and there's
hope (not certainty) for a bright future, but what if we find something?

Are we the creators of the filter event we have in front of us? Very
soon, we will be able to manipulate DNA in its small details, design and
create nanomachines from scratch, or fully understand the processes
governing our brain and body. Despite the groundbreaking nature of these
discoveries, a single accident could wipe out our civilization entirely.
It takes a match to start a fire.

Do we need, `as Stephen Hawking
says <http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn13748-stephen-hawking-calls-for-moon-and-mars-colonies.html>`_,
to start colonizing other planetary systems right now, or face the
consequences of the "all the eggs in one basket" situation we currently
have? Should we accept the fact that our current technology, knowledge
of closed biospheres and control of human psychology do not allow us to
send a crew on Mars and bring them back? Should we just start sending
people there with `no chance of coming
back <http://www.universetoday.com/2008/03/04/a-one-way-one-person-mission-to-mars/>`_?
And in any case, once humanity gets there and a colony is started, how
can people survive on a planet where water is apparently scarce and
there is no breathable air?
