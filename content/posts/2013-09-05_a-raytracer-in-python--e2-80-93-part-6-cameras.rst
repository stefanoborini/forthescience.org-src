In the `latest commit for the raytracer, I added
cameras <https://github.com/stefanoborini/python-raytrace/commit/c5fc3a3c97c46d75d378f6e8c0fa4b53a0efa7b2>`_.
The design changed so that now the responsible for rendering is the
camera object. Actual cameras are specializations of an abstract class
BaseCamera, which holds common information about positioning. The
BaseCamera is then specialized into two concrete classes:

#. PinholeCamera is a camera where rays are shot as diverging from a
   single point, called the eye\_point. This allows perspective, which
   was not present previously as the rays were emerging from the
   ViewPlane pixels.
#. LensCamera is a camera that simulates depth of field, that is,
   focus/out of focus. Contrary to the PinholeCamera, where everything
   is in focus, LensCamera allows different focusing. Objects that
   happen to be on the "focal plane" are in focus, while objects that
   are outside (either closer or farther from the camera) present less
   defined details proper of an out-of-focus object. To perform this
   effect, we need the random sampling on a disk implemented in the
   previous post.

The following picture shows how LensCamera performs. A set of
hemispheres are deployed along a line. The camera is above them,
slightly angled and with a roll angle appreciable from the horizon. In
all three cases, the orange central sphere is focused, as the focus
plane has been set to fall on the sphere's position. Note how other
objects are in focus for a Pinhole camera (left picture) which has no
depth of field by construction, and become more out of focus as the lens
size increases (1.0 in the center picture, 5.0 in the right one)

Other cameras may technically be possible: the book goes further in
deploying fisheye and stereoscopic cameras, but I am not interested in
them. I think the pinhole and lens camera are flexible enough for
quality renderings and my desire to learn.

One important feature of the Camera system is that it requires the
definition of local coordinates on the camera itself. The three vectors
defining this set of coordinates, called u, v, w in the book, are
obtained by building an orthonormal basis using the cross product
between the observation vector (the vector between the "eye" of the
camera and the look\_at point) and an "up" vector, our default being in
the same direction as the y axis. Doing the cross product of these two
vectors (observation and up) produces the third remaining vector of the
orthogonal basis centered on the camera. However, if the camera looks
straight up, or straight down, the cross product is zero and we obtain a
singularity, losing one degree of freedom (a condition also known as
`gimbal lock <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock>`_). The book
proposes to detect this condition and treat it accordingly, by either
overriding the specification and setting the vectors to an arbitrary,
well defined alternative, or by "juggling" the up vector out of
alignment so that the third vector is still defined. I decided for the
third option, ignore the problem, as I am not going to use gimbal locked
configurations for now, but it's definitely a problem to add to the todo
list.

With this post, I take a temporary break from the raytracing business. I
may add optical effects such as reflections, refractions, materials,
lights, but the point is that the amount of rays that must be propagated
for these effects to show tends to be very high. I want to venture into
CUDA, and therefore I will switch my attention to CUDA programming from
now on, integrate it with the raytracing later on, then go back to light
effects at a later stage. I will implement light effects first in
python, then use CUDA to achieve the same results. My aim is to have
fun, test CUDA/C/Python integration, compare performances, and provide a
fully python raytracer with optional C/CUDA high-performance code to
achieve the same task. For CUDA tinkering, I will switch back to my old
friend, the mandelbrot set.
