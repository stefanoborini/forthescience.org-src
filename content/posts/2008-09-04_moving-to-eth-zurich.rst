I am starting a postdoc at ETH Zürich the 1st of October. I will work on
data management and high throughput calculations in quantum chemistry,
and I will probably be involved in a standardization process (as I
already took part earlier) for communication and data sharing. The
experience I did in sequence analysis was precious, as they already
worked on standardization issues before quantum chemists. The experience
I did outside academia was important to develop a method and a rigorous
approach to programming.

I am very excited of the project and the opportunity. It will be fun and
intriguing, and it is a project that can really create new perspectives
in computational sciences.
