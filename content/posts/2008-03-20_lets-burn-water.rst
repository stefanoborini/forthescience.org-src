So, apparently you can burn saltwater

by irradiating it with radiofrequency, weakening the hydrogen-oxygen
bond to break it, and igniting the hydrogen and oxygen gas you obtain.
The burning flame can then be used to produce electricity.

My proposal is therefore the following: let's power the RF generator
with the electricity produced by the flame, and let's condensate the
water resulting from the hydrogen burning to replenish the tube. Free
energy for everybody! After all, who needs the `laws of
thermodynamics <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics>`_?
