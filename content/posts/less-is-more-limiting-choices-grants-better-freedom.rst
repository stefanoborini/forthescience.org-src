Let me start this post with the following TED talk. It lasts 20 minutes,
and it's a nice introduction to the argument of this post

I am currently in the process of choosing a web framework for a project.
Problem is: there are too many! Every single one does more or less what
I need, or I assume it does. So I would say that just picking one would
work, right ? Hardly so. The reality is: I am stuck into "choice paralysis".

**Human nature demands freedom of choice, but not out of an excessive
number of choices**. In other words, `Less is More <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice:_Why_More_Is_Less>`_.
An educate personal guess lets me believe that the underlying reason in
terms of brain wiring is the same for the `Rule of
Seven <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two>`_
and the `Hick's Law <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law>`_. As
absurd it can be, an overwhelming number of opportunities short-circuit
our decisional machine to the limit of making it useless. If you are
proposed three retirement plans, your choice will be relatively easy. If
the same company provides you 15 different retirement plans, you will
not be able to choose. On the other hand, being limited to only one
choice will trigger a sense of limitation, lack of personalization and
adaptation. We want to have our personality recognized, and express it
through our choice.

There must therefore exist `a sweet
spot <http://www.igvita.com/2007/01/18/the-non-paradox-of-choice/>`_
where these two effects compensate and maximize the satisfaction.
Needless to say, this spot is likely to be very useful for marketing
purposes, since many choices today involve money transactions. One of
the examples I find particularly interesting is Apple: Apple sells a
very limited choice of products, with a distinctive branding that puts
it in a different category. You have only three laptops, with a rather
limited choice of personalization. Their marketing aims at a reduced
amount of choices. Any other (non-Apple) laptop is just one choice out
of many very similar laptops, and choosing is more difficult.

At the opposite side of the spectrum, the perl language puts strong
focus on the assumption that you can write the same code in many
different ways:
`TIMTOWTDI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_more_than_one_way_to_do_it>`_,
or "There's More Than One Way To Do It". In other words, excess of
choice. See `[1] <http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt>`_
and
`[2] <http://wiki.dandascalescu.com/essays/paradox-of-choice-in-web-development>`_
for more discussion on this specific topic. In software development, an
excess of freedom can bring a project to a halt due to "`Analysis
Paralysis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis>`_".

It is therefore important not only to provide choice, but also to
distill it to the real, essential minimum.
