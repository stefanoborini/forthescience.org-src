According to recent results from
`WMAP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAP>`_, the universe is 13.73 ±
0.12 billion years old. Moreover, the ordinary matter accounts less than
5% of the constituents of the universe (energy and matter), and the
universe is `practically
flat <http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html>`_, in the sense
that the geometrical rules are those of an `euclidean
geometry <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry>`_.

This seems to provide even more convincing support for the `Big
Bang <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang>`_ model, and the `density
parameter <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_parameter>`_ Ω very
close to 1 seems to rule out the big crunch and so a cyclic existence of
the universe.

Putting things into perspective with the `geological
clock <http://forthescience.org/blog/2007/10/20/geologic-clock-and-evolution/>`_
it means that it took approximately 10 billions years for the Earth to
form.
