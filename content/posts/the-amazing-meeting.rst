At the beginning of October I will attend `The Amazing Meeting in
London <http://tamlondon.org>`_. Yes, I was able to grab a ticket.
Insane competition, the event sold out in just two
hours.` <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Meeting#The_Amaz.21ng_Meeting>`_

`The Amazing
Meeting <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Meeting#The_Amaz.21ng_Meeting>`_
is a meeting of scientists and skeptics organized by the James Randi
Foundation. `James Randi <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi>`_ is
a professional magician who offers a prize for anybody demonstrating a
paranormal phenomenon he cannot explain under controlled conditions
agreed by both parties. The prize, still unclaimed after 20 years, is
currently at one million dollars.

I remember a very interesting show when I was a child, organized by
James Randi in Italy. He challenged a group of
`dowsers <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowsing>`_ to find water in
controlled conditions, to prove or disprove their paranormal skills. The
(expected) result was that no dowser was able to find water (running in
pre-deployed underground pipes). Instead the claimed patterns had the
same reliability of random ones.

One of the speakers is `Adam
Savage <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Savage>`_, well known for his
TV series `Mythbusters <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters>`_ on
Discovery Channel, together with `Jamie
Hyneman <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Hyneman>`_. I'm a big fan of
the series, and I am really looking forward to meet him in person.

I will tweet from TAM on the `ForTheScience twitter
account <http://twitter.com/forthescience>`_, using the #tamlondon
channel mark.
