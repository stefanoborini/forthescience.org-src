StackExchange sites proliferation

:slug: stackexchange-sites-proliferation

I am observing with great interest the development at
`Area51 <http://area51.stackexchange.com>`_ for new Question/Answers
sites to be opened with the StackExchange system. One thing that makes
me cringe a bit is the very strong fragmentation. I think this stems
either from the need of personal protagonism of each person (nothing bad
with it, progress happens also thanks to personal protagonism), or by
lack of notice that a similar proposal has already been done. I could be
wrong though, and I accept criticism on this point.

The main problem, however, remains. Opening a StackExchange site is
**damn hard**. First you have to find at least 60 people interested in
the site. Then, when this limit is reached, a large amount of people (in
the hundreds, but it really depends on the reputation of each
participant) must commit and promise to create momentum for the site,
adding questions and answers. When this amount is reached, the site is
open and stays in closed beta for seven days. During this time, the
committers have to enrich the site so that the public beta (which starts
after the first seven days) gets enough hits and participants to show a
self-sustained community.

That said, I checked the situation. Many sites are already open, but
there is a critical lack of fundamental and potentially
"large-community" sites, such as Music, TV, Health, Travel. The system
at Area51 is engineered to let unpopular proposals die out, while other,
more popular ones gain traction, but in some cases, some coalescence
would greatly help to reach the threshold (assuming disjoint followers,
of course), at the price of losing specificity, and would allow smaller
communities to get their space. For example, Guitars is likely to open,
Drumming is less likely as there are less drum players. Having a more
general topic would allow both communities to thrive on a very powerful,
but more general musical performance site. Please note that
generalization should not be a big issue, as StackExchance sites allow
questions to be tagged with labels, and the users can choose which
labels to follow and which ones are not of their interest.

On the other hand, people will most likely subscribe to something they
are (e.g. I am a guitarist, so let's search for a "Guitars" proposal,
instead of searching for a "Musician"). These two opposite forces end up
creating a potential impasse. I think a coordination effort is missing
to coalesce fragmented sites. While I am not trying to be such a
coordinator, I am providing some food for thoughts.

This is a live post. I will update it as much as my spare time allows
doing it, and it will never be up-to-date. I am just throwing a line of
reasoning on the current situation for interested readers, in particular
from Area51. I accept ideas and criticism in the comment section.

There are some mixed points I would like to clarify and discuss. First,
my classification is rather broad and, in some cases, far fetched. For
example, poker players would cringe seeing Magic under card games, but
really, Magic **is** a card game. Other cases could even be worse, but I
tried to keep a very broad stance. The classification name (in bold) is
not an index for a "generic community that should be opened in my
opinion". It is just a guide.

Also, there is the problem of scientific Q/A that are very specialized.
Some of them gain enough traction (maths and statistics). Others fall
behind, I assume either due to a poorly collaborative community,
insufficient Public Relations effort, or excessive specialization (which
reduces the community to a handful).

In some cases, the communities focus on topics that tend to promote
**opinion answers**, rather than **factual answers**. The most striking
example are clearly religious Q/A sites. While some things can produce
factual answers (for example: "in which parts of the bible X is
discussed?" or "does the Buddhist discipline consider proper to eat
meat?"), other questions are total opinions ("Does God exist?", or "Gay
marriage law passed in X, how can we oppose it?" the most probable
ones). Although such questions would be considered off-topic, or
subjective and argumentative, religious sites are difficult to handle,
unless they are handled like a philosophy Q/A site: who said this, where
and when. Similar point with any political-oriented Q/A.

On regard of difficult to handle Q/A sites, there is "`Everything You
Always Wanted to Know about Sex but were Afraid to
Ask <http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/3303/everything-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-sex-but-were-afraid-to-ask>`_".
The site is definitely interesting from the medical point of view, but
it must be kept with strong discipline, or it can diverge from its
original intent pretty quickly.

Feel free to leave comments.
