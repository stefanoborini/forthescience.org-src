My name is Stefano Borini. I have a Ph.D. in quantum
chemistry from Ferrara University, Ferrara, Italy, and Paul Sabatier
University, Toulouse, France. My Ph.D. work focused on two ab-initio
techniques (the use of the perturbative method NEVPT and the development
of the localized orbital approach Freeze-and-Cut) and their integration
in a common software infrastructure. To satisfy these needs, also part
of my work was the definition and implementation of a file format for
data exchange in quantum chemistry, Q5Cost.

After my Ph.D. I shifted my focus toward scientific programming, being
employed both in industry and academia. In particular I worked on
Density Functional Theory on crystalline systems and electronic
transport, graph theory, data model design (at Atomistix, now
`QuantumWise <http://www.quantumwise.com/>`_), Comparative Genomics,
bioinformatics databases, book authoring (at `Center for Biological
Sequence Analysis <http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/>`_ at the Technical University
of Denmark), optical properties of conjugated compounds and RDF
databases for computational chemistry data (at `ETH
Zürich <http://www.ethz.ch/>`_, Switzerland and `National Institute of
Informatics <http://www.nii.ac.jp/index.php?action=pages_view_main&page_id=59&lang=english>`_,
Tokyo, Japan), Tight Binding DFT (at `Scientific Computing and
Modelling <http://www.scm.com/About/AboutPersonnel>`_ in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, and Jacobs University Bremen, Germany).

I am currently employed at `QuantumWise <http://www.quantumwise.com/>`_
A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark, where I am an all-round scientific software
specialist and developer, mainly focusing on MacOSX, builds, hardcore
debugging, design, and GUI programming with Qt.

My strong skills are in code refactoring and reviewing, debugging, file
formats, GUI usability, software design, computational chemistry, and
scientific writing. I always welcome new opportunities to learn and
increase my competences. I enjoy programming in many languages, with my
favorite being Python. My operating systems of choice are MacOSX and
Linux.

I like simple things, enjoy nature, an afternoon with a friend and a cup
of tea. And I like to do things for the science.
