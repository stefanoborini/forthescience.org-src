Performance of filling a numpy array

I just noticed this interesting piece of trivia. Apparently it's much faster to
create a zeros array and filling the individual values, than creating an array
from scratch by passing a list. This program

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy
   import time

   before = time.time()
   for i in xrange(10000000):
       a=numpy.zeros(6)
       a[0] = 1.0
       a[1] = 2.0
       a[2] = 3.0
       a[3] = 4.0
       a[4] = 5.0
       a[5] = 6.0
   print time.time() - before

   before = time.time()
   b=[ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
   for i in xrange(10000000):
       a=numpy.array(b)
   print time.time() - before

outputs these times on my machine

::
   11.7937290668
   49.3275549412

I don't know if this scales up, but for small arrays, creating a zero array and
then assigning seems a better strategy.
