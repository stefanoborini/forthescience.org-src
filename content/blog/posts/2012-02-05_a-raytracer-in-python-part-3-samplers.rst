A raytracer in python – part 3: samplers

In the previous post, we explored a very basic way of plotting images:
shooting a ray from the center of every pixel, and plot the color of the
object we hit. The result is a rather flat, very jagged image

Border jagging arises from the fact that we are sampling with a discrete
grid (our ViewPlane) an object that is smooth due to its functional
expression (our spheres). The sampling is by nature approximated, and
when mapped to pixels it produces either the color of the object, or the
color of the background.

We would like to remove the jagged behavior. To achieve this, we could
increase the resolution. That would make the jaggies less appreciable
thanks to a higher number of pixels. An alternative is to keep the lower
resolution, and shoot many rays per each pixels instead of only one (a
technique called
`supersampling <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersampling>`_). To
compute the final color, weighting is performed according to the number
of rays that impact vs. the total number of rays sent from that pixel.
This technique is known as
`anti-aliasing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aliasing>`_.

The figure details visually what said above: the real description of the sphere
is smooth (left hand figure). Shooting one ray per pixel, and coloring the
pixel according to hit/no-hit, produces either a fully colored pixel, or a
fully background pixel (center). With supersampling, we shoot a higher number
of rays, and per each pixel we perform weighting of the color.

As a result, the jaggies in the sphere are replaced with a smoother,
more pleasant transition

Choice of Samplers
------------------

The pattern used for the supersampled rays is important. The module
samplers in the python raytracer implements three common strategies.

Regular sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is the most intuitive and easy, and the one used above: a regular
grid of rays. It is easy to implement but it can introduce unpleasant
artifacts for more complex situations. Plotting the position of the rays
in the pixel will produce the following layout (for a 8x8 supersample
grid)

   :align: center

As we see, the layout is regular on the grid of subcells (painted yellow
and white for better visualization) that define the pixel. On the
vertical and horizontal distributions (plotted on the grey bars above
and on the left) we also see a regular distribution, but its regularity
may introduce artifacts in some cases.

Random sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Random sampling positions the rays at random within the pixel. This may
sound appealing, but it may instead end up as suboptimal: it can produce
random clumping, in particular for a small number of samples. This will
unbalance the weighting leading to an incorrect evaluation. Plotting one
distribution one may obtain

   :align: center

Note the uneven distribution of the points, leaving large parts not
sampled and other parts oversampled. In addition, the vertical and
horizontal distribution tend to be uneven.

Jittered sampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jittered sampling takes the best of both worlds: the regularity of the
Regular sampler with a degree of randomness from the Random sampler. The
idea is to select the center of each subcell and apply randomization, so
that each subcell produces only one ray, but without the artifact
inducing regularity proper of the Regular sampler.

Computational cost impact
-------------------------

Unfortunately, performing supersampling makes the creation of the image
considerably slower. In the following table you can see the timings (in
seconds) for Jittered and Regular sampling, compared against the case
with no sampling. The size of the image rendered is 200x200 pixels.

+--------------------+---------------+-----------+----------+------------+
| Sample size/sets   | No sampling   | Regular   | Random   | Jittered   |
+--------------------+---------------+-----------+----------+------------+
| 1/1                | 23            |           |          |            |
+--------------------+---------------+-----------+----------+------------+
| 4/1                |               | 68        | 63       | 160        |
+--------------------+---------------+-----------+----------+------------+
| 9/1                |               | 158       | 152      | 271        |
+--------------------+---------------+-----------+----------+------------+
| 16/1               |               | 229       | 235      | 276        |
+--------------------+---------------+-----------+----------+------------+
| 16/2               |               | 223       | 247      | 267        |
+--------------------+---------------+-----------+----------+------------+
| 16/4               |               | 240       | 277      | 260        |
+--------------------+---------------+-----------+----------+------------+

As we can see, supersampling introduces a considerably higher
computational effort. We also see that having multiple sets (a
requirement to prevent the same set of subsamples to be reused for
adjacent pixels, something that again would introduce artifacts) does
not really change the timings. According to the current implementation,
I expect this to be verified. On the other hand, I don't expect timings
for Regular and Jittered to be so different, since the creation of the
values is performed once and for all at startup. This is worth
investigating while looking for performance improvement. In the next
post I will perform profiling of the python code and check possible
strategies to reduce the timings, eventually revising the current
design.

Current implementation
----------------------

The current implementation of python-raytrace `can be found at
github <https://github.com/stefanoborini/python-raytrace/commit/00de858590b76929d216bfe0d53605ddcbde8548>`_.
In this release, I added the samplers. Samplers are derived classes of
the BaseSampler class, and are hosted in the samplers module. Derived
Samplers must reimplement ``_generate_samples``. Points are stored because
we want to be able to select sets at random as well as replay the same
points. Samplers also reimplements the ``__iter__()`` method as a
generator of (x,y) tuples, with x and y being in the interval [0.0,
1.0). Once initialized, the Sampler can therefore be iterated over with
a simple

.. code-block:: python

    for subpixel in sampler:
        # use subpixel

The World class can now be configured with different Samplers for the
antialiasing. The default Sampler is a Regular 1 subpixel Sampler, which
is the original one-ray-per-pixel sampling.
