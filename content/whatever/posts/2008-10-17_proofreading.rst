Proofreading is fun.

You proofread something with three pair of eyes for a bunch of months.
When you believe your manuscript is perfect, you send the stuff to the
editor, which after a while returns you the formatted proofs.

Then you take the proofs and print them out, and again the three pair of
eyes start again reading them. The result is that you still find a bunch
of errors! And... there's more. Each pair of eyes find errors than the
other two pairs did not spot.

But the most funny part is when you send a document containing the
cumulated corrections to the editor, and reviewing this document you
spot errors in it.

You just have to live with it. A book will **never** be without errors.
