Suppose you want to generate a large number of random dice rolls for a
computer program. How do you do it ? With a robotic dice rolling
machine, of course

Why would anyone need such device, I hear you ask? Well, software random
number generators are technically not perfectly random, and if you have
to reassure a crowd of people complaining about your rolls' randomness,
this solution is straightforward, creative, and a `real pleasure to read
in its gory and unexpected technical
