Kitchen scheduling and administration

I don't like TV, but occasionally I get to something that pokes my
brain. I am an interested observer of a TV "reality show" called
"`Gordon's Kitchen
Nightmares <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_Nightmares>`_".
Professional chef `Gordon
Ramsay <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Ramsay>`_ travels from
restaurant to restaurant in order to analyze and
(`allegedly? <http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/jun/20/broadcasting.usnews>`_)
try to fix their troublesome financial issues, generally due to bad
managerial and food preparation habits.

The point of this introduction is that I am fascinated by restaurant
kitchens. It's an impressive task of scheduling, management and resource
optimization for a reliable quality of service, under an insane amount
of time pressure. When it comes down to a professional environment that
requires fully dedicated and flawless teamwork, nothing compares to
restaurants. OK, probably train stations and airports, but that's a
different scale. Here are some of the issues they have to handle:

-  Different food likely requires different preparation time, but when
   you receive an order from a table, people sitting at that table are
   supposed to get the food at the same time.
-  Some components can be prepared beforehand, thus paying the price of
   a slow preparation step earlier, when the restaurant is still closed.
   When the actual meal needs to be prepared, the component is ready to
   be used. It is then important to decide which components can (and
   must) be prepared beforehand, and the appropriate quantities (so that
   there's enough for the whole evening, but not too much so that it
   expires) while at the same time preserving food quality.
-  If someone gets a first course, the second course is supposed to come
   after a while, giving him the time to eat the first, relax a few
   minutes, and start the second. Timings must be calibrated so that the
   client doesn't get the second course too early (while he is still
   eating the first one) or too late (having him wait for too long). In
   addition, if you have a table of people, clearly you should start
   serving the second course when every guest finished their first one.
-  Stoves, ovens, ranges and helper chefs are finite resources that must
   be allocated properly. If you have to prepare ten portions of
   spaghetti, you don't use ten helpers and ten ranges at the same time.
   Ovens have a fixed maximum capacity, and you have to take it into
   account if extensive use is required, eventually at different
   temperatures.
-  A broad menu requires a lot of ingredients, hence more space in the
   fridge, and more stuff that is potentially unused at expiration date,
   thus increasing waste. A small menu is more manageable, but it
   removes customer choice and customer return value, which drives
   profits.
-  A large amount of tables puts more strain on the kitchen, increasing
   the likelihood that the waiting times will become unsustainable,
   hurting the restaurant's reputation. A small amount of tables leads
   to less pressure on the kitchen, but it also means reduced earning
   and less picks from the menu, increasing the likelihood of expired
   food in the fridge.
-  There are two major and very different patterns of client flow: the
   mass commit (such as at opening time, or if a whole bus of tourists
   decides to stop by and have a meal) and the constant flow, where the
   new orders are regularly spaced and evenly distributed in time. In
   both cases, a well organized kitchen must deliver food within an
   acceptable time span after the order has taken place.
-  The chef must choose the proper menu that optimizes preparation time,
   resource usage, ingredient consumption, price, local taste of
   customers, preparation skills of his team.
-  The size of the dishes is important for business. Nobody wants to see
   a big dish with a small portion in it, unless you are a famous
   `Nouvelle Cuisine <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouvelle_cuisine>`_
   chef, of course. Normal customers in normal restaurants prefer a
   proportionate amount, so a large dish forces a large amount of food
   to be put in. Customers leaving with `doggy
   bags <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggy_bag>`_ are indicative of an
   excessive amount of served food, which is a waste of money and
   requires high prices leading to a less competitive restaurant.
-  In some cases, preparations (or part of it) can be delegated to the
   waiter, thus freeing kitchen manpower. Examples are desserts (e.g.
   burning the sugar on the Crème brûlée with a torch, or cutting a big
   roasted chicken directly at the table for both delegation and
   customer satisfaction)
-  On top of all this, the kitchen has to deliver good food, from good
   fresh ingredients.

And let's not underestimate additional human factors. Being a
professional chef means that the salary is most likely low, the work
schedule tough, and there are no regular vacations, but if you get
proficient enough and you have some good professional connections and a
bit of luck, you can get to work on one of these

It kind of helps... I think.
