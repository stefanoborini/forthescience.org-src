The Large Hadron Collider just achieved the first collisions among
protons at 7 tera electronvolts (TeV) at center of mass, smashing
together two beams of protons at 3.5 TeV each. The setup has been
compared to shooting needles from opposite sides of the Atlantic and
have them impact halfway.

What we have today in front of us is a historical achievement. For the
very first time, such high-energy impacts are obtained in a controlled
experimental setup. Nature performs the same experiment every day since
billions of years: at every instant, high energy particles coming from
distant sources in the depth of the universe, the cosmic rays, hit the
atoms in our high atmosphere. Their energies are even higher than the
ones achieved at LHC, but no detector exists up there to see what
happens in controlled conditions. The energy of 7 TeV is actually half
of the final target: LHC will be able to reach 14 TeV when fully
operational, hopefully in a couple of years.

With such powerful and sensitive experimental setup, physicists at CERN
will be able to understand more details about our universe, how it
started, and the rules it has to obey.
