I am writing this post from my iPod touch. I am not enthusiast at all of
the device, and I would gladly return it, but I am in a "no choice"
situation. The reasons for my disappointment are the all-well-known
limitations of the device, in particular the limit to only one
application running at a time, and the lock-in with the Apple store.
From the hardware point of view is a nice device, but the battery life
is basically one day with WiFi constantly running. Not enough, but I
don't think any better can be done: WiFi is a drain, and batteries have
physical limits. Concluding, there is chance for improvement, the
limitations are either software or legalware. As a non fanatic Apple
client, I hope Apple will do the right moves, otherwise I will be glad
to migrate to an Android based tablet as soon as available (cannot have
a phone, this is the reason behind the touch). The Archos 5 seems
interesting. Let's see if it survives the hype.
