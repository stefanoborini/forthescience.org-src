Today, an era ends.

Today the last Shuttle, Atlantis, is scheduled to land for the last time
, closing the era of the Shuttle missions, and basically the Space age.

Why I say so?

Well I don't think I should spend low-grade effort explaining something
that has already `been professionally written at the
Economist <http://www.economist.com/node/18897425>`_. Instead, I want to
say thank you.

I want to say thank you to everyone that made this marvel of technology
possible, a companion of life, the visible proof of what humans could
accomplish if they just focused on "doing" rather than "babbling",
catching dreams rather than following lies, concentrate rather than
disperse. Unfortunately, it is painful to observe that the US
technological advancement when it comes to space arose from a
head-to-head with USSR during the cold war. There was nothing
inspirational about it. It was just a field where the US could beat, and
indeed won, a war of propaganda against their enemy of the time. Were
the field have been how to prepare delicious fried potatoes, today we
would have the best frying pan ever produced by mankind.

But I digress. We took the chance, and won our race, as humans, to free
ourselves from the comfort of our own planet, and got there, in the
weightless darkness that can kill and amaze you.

The country who gave us this:

and this

Today `puts in this
activity <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA>`_ less money than
those `required to air-condition soldier's tents (check the
audio) <http://www.theworld.org/2010/07/military-base-close-to-the-front/>`_.
True ? False ? I don't know. I also don't know how true it is that `US
budget costs in
2010 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_federal_budget>`_
for the Department of Defense is 663 billions dollars, vs. 46.7 billions
for Department of Education and 26.3 billions for Department of Energy.
That's 7 % and 3.9 % respectively of the DoD budget. These are the
numbers I found. As accurate they may be, still they explain a lot about
the current status of the country.
