Proper dress code and behavior in the apiary is a critical component of
being a beekeeper. Here is a quick list of my experience so far.

General advice and behavior
---------------------------

Hives are generally in places where the grass can be tall, and the dirt
everywhere. Be careful about ticks if you live in a tick-infested area.
Wear proper shoes that give good grip and offer some protection in the
unfortunate case a super falls on your foot. This is not proper shoewear

Don't shoo the bees with your hands like a crazy ninja. Bees are
natively curious. Unless you are actively doing something in the hive,
they won't sting you, they are just checking you out.

Don't wear perfumes, bright colors, or make excessive noise. Don't stay
in front of the hive exit unless you are properly dressed. When
manipulating the supers and the frames, act slowly and with accuracy,
trying to kill as few bees as possible.

Lift the weight with your legs, not with your back. Supers can get
really heavy, up to 15-20 kg. If someone can help you, share the weight.

To prevent the spreading of diseases, you should never use the same suit
and gloves in a different apiary that is not your own. If you visit a
friend's apiary, it's better if you borrow a suit from him, rather than
using your own.

The beesuit
-----------

When it comes to suits, the choice is generally about color and how much
of your body you want to cover. For the color, white or grey/brown are
more or less the standard, for the obvious reason that any other color
would be attractive to bees. With a white suit it is easier to recognize
when it needs a wash. When it comes to covering type, you can choose
either a full, head-to-toe suit or a jacket. I bought the full suit,
which is in my opinion impractical: a good pair of thick jeans offers
enough protection, and the jacket is easier to wash, store, wear and
remove. The only advantage of the suit, and the reason why I bought it,
is that it protects your jeans from dirt, but in the end it's a matter
of choice between dirty jeans and dirty suit. A jacket is fine for most
purposes.

The head protection is the most critical part of the suit: it should be
completely detachable to simplify washing, and it should give you a
comfortable and stable field of view. My suit `uses a hat-like shape
like this
one <http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beekeepers-Suit-With-Removable-Round/dp/B00BAX3SUU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1371896285&sr=8-1&keywords=beesuit>`_,
which I find rather impractical as it tends to move on my head, and
leaves me with a field of view looking down. I haven't tried other suit
models, but if I had to buy another suit, I would go with `the
helmet-type <http://www.amazon.co.uk/BeeKeeping-Bee-Suit-Veil-Small/dp/B0071JWYNY/ref=pd_sim_sbs_petsupplies_4>`_
as likely to be the most comfortable option. Your mileage may vary, but
I reiterate the importance for a removable head protection. Washing the
suit is generally best done by hand, with a smell-neutral washing
powder. You can `technically use a washing
machine <http://apiarylandlord.wordpress.com/apiary-diary/how-do-you-wash-your-bee-suit/>`_,
but only if the face net can be removed.

If you are one of the lucky people with `a mouth-held
smoker <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbUjC5nYqnw&feature=related>`_
(rather rare, but extremely convenient), some suits provide a hole for
it, but it can also be easily self-made with some leather.

The gloves
----------

As an inexperienced beekeeper I bought leather gloves

They are certainly good for heavy protection, but I advise against them.
Thick plastic gloves are the ones you want, for two reasons: they are
easier to wash and sterilize, reducing the chance of transmitting
diseases, and they have better grip and flexibility.
