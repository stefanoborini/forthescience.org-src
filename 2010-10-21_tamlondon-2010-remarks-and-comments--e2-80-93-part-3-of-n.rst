This post continues my review on TAMLondon 2010. I will go into details
of the audience and the talks, and memorable quotes. I keep the
individual talks for the last post, due tomorrow.

**The audience**: with an audience reaching one thousand delegates (more
than twice the first edition), question time was in some cases limited,
but the questions intriguing. Approximately half of the delegates were
Brits, the other half from the rest of Europe. A thumb-statistics survey
from chitchat and nametag-gazing would indicate strong presence of
Scandinavian countries, Sweden and Norway in particular. Some delegates
were also from Hungary, Spain, Switzerland, Ireland. Strongly
underrepresented Italy, with only a very cheerful and pleasant lady I
met in the last minutes of the meeting, and of course myself. Around 60
% of the audience was male. The average age was around 30, ranging from
15 to over 60. Concerning the profession, I heard about tourist
operators, managers, box manufacturers, computer programmers, students
and academics, but my sample is very limited in size.

**The speakers and the talks**: a very broad set of presentation styles
was available. Most speakers preferred a freestyle speech with a minimal
number of slides. I reckon a maximum of four or five slides in talks
using them. The speakers were in any case incredibly good in keeping the
audience interested in every detail, even when no supporting slides were
present.

Interviews were definitely over-represented. In comparison, I don't
recall any interview from last year's TAM. As I previously said, I think
this introduced some occasional yawn, but I don't want to give the
impression they were boring. It's a matter of rhythm.
