I read with strong interest this post "`How Hard Science Saves Lives <http://www.science20.com/planetbye/how_hard_science_saves_lives>`_"
from `Bente Lilja Bye <http://www.science20.com/profile/bente_lilja_bye>`_ at Science 2.0.
I will make a very short summary for presentation purposes, but I
encourage to read through her very interesting post.

The point being made, shortly stated, is the argument between
hard-science and soft-science representatives on saving human lives
through hard-science research. With hard-science is intended chemistry,
geology, mathematics, physics, and any other discipline requiring the
application of the scientific method to rigorous, quantifiable
information; On the other hand, soft-science are disciplines like
sociology, political science, psychology, and more generally encompasses
journalists, politicians, and the layperson. The controversy is that
hard-science research doesn't save lives, a position brilliantly refuted
in the post with effective and concrete examples.

I had the same issues with soft-science scholars in the past; similar
personal experiences, where scientific knowledge is not considered
strictly as "culture", or where the fact of not understanding math or
chemistry was presented as an asset to be proud of, rather than a lack
of knowledge to compensate as soon as possible with simple, plain
curiosity. I also observe that many scientists and hard-science
practitioners I know are also generally interested in philosophy, arts,
sociology, psychology, behavior, literature, and they actively search
for more information on these topics. On the other hand, soft-science
representatives I know, seldom search for accessible scientific
knowledge to complement their expertise.

Where does this issue comes from? What are the reasons behind the pure
existence of the argument? What can be made to address the issue? I
seldom use this blog for "opinion posts", but I think the observation
that such issue exists in the first place is a phenomenon that, as
scientists, we should analyze by virtue of its intrinsic existence. The
risk to neglect this analysis is lingering misunderstanding and falsity,
and as scientists it is our duty to promote the truth.

I personally believe there are many factors to be considered for this
analysis. It is a complex and long post, so I tried to make it
manageable. I divided my post into different sections, one for each
factor. In each section, I will

#. try to analyze one specific factor I consider important
#. analyze the root causes of the issue
#. propose possible strategies for mitigation.

I will rely solely on my experience for this analysis, which can be in
some cases not factual nor representative of a general behavior. You
will feel a lot of `weasel
words <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word>`_, a lot of "citation
needed" spots along the way. I am aware of this, and I basically risk to
become what I criticize in lack of proper communication, thus condemning
myself. I plead guilty and appeal to the `McKean's
law <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_McKean>`_ extended to concepts
and the `Gödel's incompleteness
theorems <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel's_incompleteness_theorems>`_
for extenuation causes. I also declare I am ready to change my
statements in response to additional experiences complementing or
refuting the points being made.

Factor n. 1: Need a map for the research maze
---------------------------------------------

**Analysis**: Earth, 2010 AD. Humanity reached an interesting level of
development of new technologies. Research, started when the first human
knapped his first rock into a knife, continues to give interesting new
answers and solutions, as well as new and intriguing questions. More
research is needed for better understanding. So, here we are, building
the Large Hadron Collider, shooting rockets into space to bring humans
to the Moon and robots to Mars, deploying space telescopes and
satellites to peek into the depth of space to see the origin of the
universe, the innards secrets of our closest star and the behavior of
our spaceship, this planet.

Some of the 7 billions people living on this spaceship of water and
rocks is left puzzled by questions: does the Large Hadron Collider save
human lives? Does space exploration? Does observing the Sun or the
Earth? If you ask the layperson "Do you think that smashing little
particles together will save lives?", I would not be surprised the
average answer to be a resounding "No".

Let's time warp with our mind to the 18th century. Funny dressed,
strange people burn substances in their laboratories and weight the
remaining ashes. Let's take a walk on the streets of our 18th century
village and tell a commoner that "`Mr.
Lavoisier <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lavoisier>`_ spends his
time weighting stuff, burning it and weighting the ashes. Do you think
it will save your life?". What would you expect the answer to be ?

Did this activity save lives? In retrospect, definitely yes: their
research allowed the demise of the
`phlogiston <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory>`_ and the
`four classical
elements <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element>`_ as key
substances, paving the way to finally understand how matter and heat
work. This result boosted 19th century chemists into discovering the
structure of natural substances and synthesize new ones. If you followed
my series on the "Eight molecules that changed the rules of the game,"
you probably noticed
`penicillin <http://forthescience.org/blog/2010/03/11/eight-molecules-that-changed-the-rules-of-the-game-penicillin/>`_
and
`cisplatin <http://forthescience.org/blog/2010/04/08/eight-molecules-that-changed-the-rules-of-the-game-cisplatin/>`_.
No person today would negate the incredible advancement in terms of
"saving life" these two substances granted us. I am the first in line on
this regard: I am the direct descendant of a person who was saved from
an aggressive TBC infection thanks to the first commercial antibiotics.
Without this advancement, I would have never been born. This was
possible thanks to the rules discovered by boring people who dedicated
their lives to the useless activity of burning stuff and weighting
ashes.

Another example? Chemistry is a discipline basically born from
metallurgy, with a Vision so fantastic we are amazed at its ambition:
`transmute vile metals into
gold <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher%27s_stone>`_. Alchemy and
chemistry looked for such ambitious goal for centuries, finding many
other incredible things along the way. When the Vision was finally
reached it was completely and totally useless for the original purpose
of becoming rich: nuclear interconversion from lead to gold is possible,
but absolutely impractical. Nevertheless, among the consequences of that
Vision are nanotechnology and `breeder
reactors <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Breeder_Reactor>`_, but
everything started because of the need of changing a lump of lead into
gold (which would have made gold as worthless as lead, but that's the
funny part of economics).

To stay in the present, consider this: without studying
superconductivity no Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; without transistors no
computers; without lasers no corrective surgery, cd players, internet;
without studying the electrons, no TVs and radios. All these findings
were totally useless when they were discovered, because the context in
which they were discovered did not yet understand their potential.

**Root cause**: What I wrote above tells a story of misunderstanding
from the layperson. The idea that the scientific research process
appears to perform useless tasks. This idea is based on different root
causes. The first two causes are

-  **Lack of understanding of how the scientific method works**
-  **Lack of understanding of how the discovery pipeline works**

and they are relative to methodology. A layperson with no formal skills
in the scientific methodology does not know what's going on in our labs,
nor he knows how hard is to do proper research, what are the usual steps
to take, the mechanisms to use, the validation and peer-reviewing
process. He also does not know that very often the solution of a problem
comes from a different discipline who happens to hit the right spot. We
are like hundreds of people walking into a maze on different routes at
the same time. Each one occasionally tears down walls for the trapped
others.

Then there's the indirect nature of research. I have the feeling that
the human mind is not well versed towards assessing risk or predicting
consequential effects, unless they are direct and immediate. Indirect
solutions to problems are "unnatural". This is strange in my opinion:
when humanity left the trees we learned to use tools and grow crops,
which is a very indirect process to get food. Hard-science research is a
very, very indirect strategy to solve problems. Very often, in order to
solve one problem, we solve a plethora of other ones either by accident
or on purpose. It's easy to say "the Large Hadron Collider is a huge
waste of money" on a big title in the newspaper. Less easy to remember
and point out that "without the LHC, there would be no World Wide Web
(or at least, it would be not what it is today)", among the many other
advancements that the LHC promoted. It's easier to criticize X when the
many positive results this X produces are not in the Vision, the final
goal out of the maze. I have the feeling that the general public
interprets these positive results not as a victory, but as unexpected
accidental results, tiny edible bits in a "rotten" project. They are
unable to grasp that without the "useless project", there would be no
need for the "small good bits" that become major technological
advancement. This is, of course, regardless of the breakthrough that the
project Vision will grant in the future, which comes much much later in
time. This must be kept into consideration when communicating to the
layperson. I am not sure it is well explained.

It is also important to explain the costs of research, which strongly
characterizes the research pipeline structure and management. Science
moved from rich's people basements into large scale investments. We need
more money to let research happen, for many reasons: we need better
technologies to measure very faint but very important effects; we need
people to create complex software able to analyze the data on massively
parallel computers; we need to dig into complex biological systems we
are not able to understand individually, simply because they are too big
for a single human's mind; we need multiple disciplines at the same time
to solve a problem. There's a cost, but it keeps people employed
producing technology, which in turns push the Gross Domestic Product
upwards, producing benefits for everybody.

The third root cause is not methodological, but intrinsic:

-  **Lack of understanding the complex nature of nature**

The layperson has no clear grasp of the noisy data we measure, or the
superlinear scalability of interactions, like those found in Systems
Biology, for example. Superlinearity in the number of problems to solve
requires superlinearity in amount of scientific investigation required
to make sense to the details.

**Mitigating options**: The problem is clearly due to of lack of
dissemination. A visual guide to the scientific method and research
pipeline is needed. The layperson needs simple statements and examples
that clearly explain the philosophy of science and the scientific
method, from Galileo to Popper. The same guide should also explain the
discovery and publication pipeline, the concepts of Vision and
Milestones in a scientific project, the current problems science is
trying to address and why, how a given Country's scientific board is
organized, the background and curricula of all the involved
personalities, the five, ten and 20 years development plan.

Factor n.2: The illusion of the sudden breakthrough
---------------------------------------------------

**Analysis**: This factor is threefold, and has to do both with
breakthroughs:

#. **the scarcity of "usable" breakthroughs**
#. **the overabundance of "unusable" breakthroughs, and**
#. **the "breakthrough fatigue".**

I'll explain the exact meaning of the quoted words in a second.

When we study the history of scientific discovery, we are presented with
sudden, life changing breakthroughs (which I will call "usable
breakthroughs") in a fast-paced exposition: the invention of plastic,
the discovery of penicillin, the radio, a rocket fires and we are on the
moon. What we are never told is the tens of years of "useless research"
which preceded these breakthroughs. Ongoing research, in comparison,
seems slow, dull and full of "useless research" because we are here to
witness it, without the "long story short, they invented penicillin"
narrative method. To an observer of the current scientific progress,
there's a stark contrast between these two presentation styles, and the
misunderstanding "Why in the past they discovered everything so quickly
and now we can't ?" quickly follows. On this sense, there's apparent
scarcity of "usable" (i.e. life changing) breakthroughs.

Then there's overabundance of "unusable breakthroughs". Almost daily, we
read on the news sites "Researchers discover new drug to cure X", but
from the lab discovery to the FDA approval (and hence commercialization)
the process takes years. When this finally happens, it won't hit the
news, aired at every corner. It will hit your prescription, in a room
containing you and your doctor. A real world example straight out of the
newspaper today: "Say goodbye to glasses. Discovered gene for myopia".
The exaggerated and invalid content of such headline is evident.

As said in the previous Factor, the general public lacks a clear picture
of the mechanisms behind the steps needed for the commercialization of a
research product, and the amplification of these findings not backed up
by an actual availability in the stores appears a constant joke where
new discoveries are announced but they cannot take advantage of them,
hence they must be false, overrated, and for sure unusable. This blows
to incredible proportions when the same line of thought is applied to
some hard sciences, where announced breakthroughs in addition don't
solve an immediate problem a common person faces, such as health or
lifestyle.

Finally, there's breakthrough fatigue. We are so surrounded with
fast-paced amazing technology that we miss the intrinsic power of it.
Today we have: digital cameras fitting in a pocket, sleek cellphones
looking like a glass shell, games resembling interactive movies,
paper-thin 52 inches screens, the internet, people orbiting around our
planet for months, people remote controlling a car on mars, people
getting their detached limbs reattached, face transplants, any common
disease has an often successful treatment, and much much more. Just
going back 15 years ago, all this was not possible. Overwhelmed with the
trend, we basically don't recognize breakthroughs anymore, because we
raised the bar so much for "revolutionary" that every new thing is
simply considered part of the normal trend.

**Root cause**: While the root cause of the previous Factor was lack of
dissemination, the root cause of this factor is improper, excessive
dissemination, generally through the words of writers that are not
scientifically knowledgeable to perform an equilibrated evaluation of
the real discovery, in particular the "how", "when", "why", and "if"
some new discovery will affect our life.

Another root cause again has to do with the lack of revolutionary
science fiction writers and science popularizers today. The genre had
its golden years after the second world war, and produced important
dreamer and trend-setters like Heinlein, Asimov, Clarke, Crichton, Sagan
and many others, who in turn inspired a generation of positive science
enthusiasm. These writers set the bar for what is considered
"revolutionary", conveying this bar to the general public in an easy and
pleasant form. Today, the genre is underrepresented and poorly followed
by the general public.

**Mitigating options** : promote good dissemination and discourage
incorrect dissemination, but with a positive attitude. Work
**for** correct dissemination, rather than **against** incorrect
dissemination. The major issue with correcting people's mistakes is that
both parties develop an attitude, which creates potential attrition and
more attitude. We have very good sites for positive dissemination out
there, but the issue is the level of communication. Those who make and
spread the news are often the firsts requiring proper scientific
training and clarification. Some very rough random cerebral activity on
potential strategies:

-  An "Adopt a journalist" initiative to address his/her doubts when
   writing scientific articles
-  Promote a point of contact between scientists and journalists within
   the institutions, relying more on direct communication and less on
   cold and sterile press releases
-  An incubator for science fiction writers. Use of the plots to develop
   open source games to reach the general public.
-  Coalescence of many popular science sources into a federated union
   for scientific popularization, with a peer-review process aimed at
   improvement, rather than filtering.

Factor n. 3: Babel reloaded
---------------------------

**Analysis**: Suppose you don't understand English. Would you classify
everything written in English as useless for humanity? Probably not, but
certainly is useless for you.

Unfortunately, I found instances where even the first line of reasoning
is applied: "I don't understand mathematics, so it's useless nonsense."
I won't go into the details of this position now, leaving it for Factor
n. 5: Having an attitude.

A proper understanding of science requires highly specific languages and
terms, such as domain-specific jargon, and specific logical and
mathematical assets and tools, the most prominent probably is
Statistics. In addition, statistics takes years of practice to dissipate
the doubts arising from its occasional counter-intuitive behavior.

On the other side of the communication bridge, hard-scientists are
generally unable (either for lack of skills or time) to communicate
major scientific facts easily (although, I agree, there are topics where
it's really, really hard). The lack of a "common sharing protocol"
exacerbates attitudes from both parts (see Factor n. 5).

We have therefore a group of people unable to understand, supposedly
listening to people unable to explain. Deaf against mute. In Computer
Science this problem is solved by the
`Adapter <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern>`_ and
`Facade <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern>`_ design patterns:
translate meaningless communication protocols into meaningful ones.
Seems trivial, but it's a good part of the problem.

**Root cause**: there are root causes from both sides: the layperson is
unable to receive because he is lacking fundamental concepts, sometimes
even basic language skills. When even the basic language words are
difficult to understand, the content cannot get through regardless of
the clarity of the explanation. It would be like having a book written
half in native language, and half in an alien language. The root cause
lies probably in school education, the mechanism of training,
evaluation, reward and punishment. I'm probably not saying anything new
here.

Scientists on the other hand need to improve their communication skills,
which is, dare to say, not as easy as it sounds, and in most cases not
their core business. Scientists should do science, and communicate their
results properly. Their skills are in the jargon-filled realm. Very few
scientists are also good communicators to the general public, because
they are not trained in communication, and because good communication is
fundamentally an art: you can train it, but nothing beats a native
charismatic and excellent communicator.

**Mitigating options**: So what's the direction? Here a large part of
the issue is strictly political. Schools need to improve. The future
starts in the classroom. People must be guided, and not fed with
knowledge for just 4 hours a day by tired, scared teachers. Once a
person enters school, it's the duty of the government to guarantee the
message reaches the audience clearly, eventually with simplifications
for specific individuals, but the level of the great picture must be
uniform. I'd compare knowledge to an image: you can have a high
resolution image or a low resolution one. Both represent the same
subject as a whole. If you have a dark square in the middle, the image
is useless. It's better to reduce the resolution, and get the image
whole. Similarly, letting a person continue in its adulthood with a dark
square in some disciplines ruins his image of the world. That dark
square will get filled with fear, uncertainty and doubt.

But school is not the only issue: **can we make better museums?**

I recently started visiting museums with a goal in mind: to see if they
are well made. I've seen various levels of the spectrum. Most small
scale museums are made **by** museum creators **for** museum creators,
**not for the audience**. I can depict the following experiences:

-  Poor labeling in hard to see characters, generally at heights not
   comfortable for children.
-  Excessive redundancy of artifacts. I don't care of seeing ten fossils
   on the same argument. One is enough. Stay brief and to the point.
-  Missing, or difficult to access complementary information. If you say
   "this fossil is from the Ordovician", I don't have to lift my head
   and look for a poorly made overhead panel with the geologic clock.
   Make the geologic clock "built-in" into the presentation.
-  Poor pictures and panels where the concept is not really explained
   unless you already have previous knowledge
-  Lack of interactivity. I'm not referring to touchscreens. I am
   referring to tinker toys. Let people touch the science. Let them
   actively do science while in the museum.
-  Lack of skilled personnel able to explain and present scientific
   facts clearly.
-  Lack of public shows demonstrating scientific principles attracting
   an audience without boring them to death. You have 10 seconds to
   catch someone's attention and keep him interested. Nobody sits in
   front of a projection for more than 15 seconds. Once you bore someone
   away, the message does not get through.
-  No return value. A museum has to change, evolve, host occasional
   events, act as a collector of expertise, a point of coalescence for
   those who want to know more. If the museum stays immutable, there's
   no value in going back in four months, in a year, or in five years.
-  Poor communication between the museum, the institutions (for services
   like transport and advertisement) and the scientists who can provide
   new cool things to demonstrate.

One of the best examples I've seen is the `Tokyo Miraikan
Museum <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraikan>`_, which is my golden
standard when it comes to museums (although it's not perfect, but pretty
close). I've never been to the `Milan Science and Technology
museum <http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_nazionale_della_scienza_e_della_tecnologia_Leonardo_da_Vinci>`_,
but judging from their website, I feel they also did a great job. These
are, however, big museums, in big cities. Dissemination of scientific
knowledge should be accessible easily, with strong locality. Children
are the prime motor for curiosity, and the exposition should be mainly
tailored to them. Parents will follow as a natural consequence.

Yes, most of the problems I decry here are due to lack of money. There
are, however, resources that can be proficiently used, such as
volunteers from associations, University students and Ph.Ds, theater
companies, hobbyists, radio amateurs, retired seniors. I am aware I
could be an idealist, and this may be just wishful thinking:
volunteering does not pay electricity bills; a museum is hardly a
business, maybe not even a no-profit one. A strategic decision to invest
in knowledge is needed from a higher administrative level.

Museums are not the only resources for proper dissemination. Cartoons,
Video Games, novels, movies. Disney performed useful documentaries such
as `Donald in Mathmagic
Land <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_in_Mathmagic_Land>`_ and `Our
Friend the Atom <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Friend_the_Atom>`_
(regardless of the propaganda period, it did have a crucial scientific
dissemination value); Disregarding the naive plot, I really enjoyed
"`The Sorcerer's
Apprentice <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorcerer%27s_Apprentice_%282010_film%29>`_"
core message: the nerdy, socially inept protagonist saves the world
through his knowledge of science, rather than magic. Big Bang Theory
made nerds funny and brought to the general public terms like "string
theory". We need more of this. We need more
`Mythbuster <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythbuster>`_, more
`Brainiac <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainiac:_Science_Abuse>`_, more
`SuperQuark <http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperQuark>`_. Please note
that I say "more of this". I'm not saying "less of something else". If
you build it, they will come if you build it well.

Factor n. 4 : The weirdo who puts science before family
-------------------------------------------------------

**Analysis**: The development of a researcher is a long process,
requiring years of investment. Typically, a researcher's career must end
into scientific management (i.e. professorship), otherwise the person is
thrown out of the academic system. Seldom there's a different direction.
It's a big risk, and people tend to shun a life of compromises,
political issues, low salaries and satisfaction in favor of a more
finalized specialization, closer to better employment possibilities when
the project, or career attempt, is drawn to a close.

Could this effect produce a cumulative rejection of hard-science? A
rejection not because of the discipline per-se, but because of a
migration of frustration concerning the associated lifestyle into the
perceived usefulness and satisfaction level provided? I would picture
something along these lines: "Screw hard-science, I don't want to work
myself to death and find myself 40, single and childless, moving every
year. I have other priorities." or "Screw science, I'm already 35,
single and childless. I'm looking for a normal job and get over it. It's
not worth it".

The public stereotype of the scientist is well known: if good, he is an
inept asocial nerd with a good heart but too many quirks. If bad, he is
the essence of evilness, madness and uncontrolled anger. These
stereotypes are probably rooted in old literature, such as Dr. Jekill
and Mr. Hyde, or Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Regardless of the origin,
normal people don't think to scientists as normal people. Either with
reverence or with resistance, scientists are considered different, and
thus "not normal", and who can raise any objection, really? A
scientists' lifestyle is far from normal in layperson's terms. Once this
separation exists, communication becomes more difficult.

Academia works in a very unusual way. I love to compare academia to a
private company to picture the idiosyncrasies of the system. Let's
describe together Academia Corp. Ltd.:

#. All newly hired personnel will have to attend an unpaid five years
   general training phase, followed by additional three years poorly
   paid specialization phase. After this phase of strong training, they
   are technically able to do their job, but in most cases, they are
   fired or choose to look for different employment.
#. Those who stay are productive in the company for one or two years.
   After this period, regardless of their productivity they are probably
   fired, sending to a competitor their expertise.
#. Employees within the company are either working on completely
   unrelated issues with no expertise sharing, or even in direct
   competition.
#. Each employee, regardless of his position in the company, must find
   clients as if he is also working in marketing, provide free
   consulting as if he's also working in customer support and convince
   venture capitalists to pay his salary and part of the company's live
   expenses as if he's working as a VP/CTO.
#. Very often a high-expertise employee continues his job, but is hired
   with a janitor contract just to keep him in.
#. Every project is responsibility of a single employee, without backup
   in case of sickness, pregnancy, or resigning. When one of these
   events occur, the project grinds to a halt, as well as all its
   dependencies.
#. Every employee deals with colleagues that are on the other side of
   the globe. These colleagues work for competitors and frequently have
   no real interest in the employee's task. In other cases, they
   actively disrupt it.
#. Evaluation of an employee's productivity is done through assessment
   of amount of products sold, and how important is the client. Before
   getting to the client, the product is tested by quality assurance,
   which is an anonymous competitor (who is also trying to sell a
   similar product to the client).
#. If an employee does not become the company CEO within 10 years, he is
   fired regardless of his skills and expertise.

I wouldn't invest a cent in such a company.... but maybe I'm excessive.
To be fair, Academia **does produce science** (and it's very good at
it). It's just very hard, if not impossible, to be a researcher as a
long-term profession. People employed for Academia Corp. Ltd. have very
poor chances of developing a traditional, job-and-family lifestyle.
External observers build a very negative opinion about this lifestyle
and its protagonists due to diversity and lack of understanding.
Researchers on the other hand tend to develop a strong attitude and
inner toughness, mingled with political overtones aimed at general
backstabbing. Scary? you bet, but that's how it is. I doubt this climate
makes academia (and by reflection, science) amicable to externals.

**Root cause** The root cause is hard to address. It's simply the way
it is. Academia is a competitive environment where only the best excel,
and they become the best because they had the opportunity to stay longer
in the system, thus getting better and better. Some type of research
(e.g. geology) requires relocation to forsaken places by its very
nature. Others require frequent exchanges with remote expertise.
**Academia is by definition an industry that produces brain power, thus
has no interest in keeping old expertise inside. Its role is to produce
new expertise in a cutting edge environment, and get fresh minds and
fresh ideas into the mechanism.**

Regardless of what said above, I believe we have a public image issue.
We appear strange because we have a strange lifestyle. We just have to
let people understand that we'd probably like to have home and children,
we simply don't have easy conditions for this to happen due to the
nature of our employment.

**Mitigation options**: I really have no opinion on this regard. Maybe
we should clarify what is scientific passion, how curiosity makes us
click since the first time we disassembled the TV remote to see what's
inside, but I doubt this can soften the stereotype.

Factor n.5: Having an attitude
------------------------------

**Analysis**: despite the best efforts towards dissemination, there will
always be someone who fights against. `Haters gonna
hate <http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/haters-gonna-hate>`_. You could say
"Let them to". In most cases it's a sensible solution. Pick your goals
wisely. So long for the attitude from the receiver side.

What about the attitude of hard-science practitioners? I see many
instances of strong attitude from highly reputed scientists I totally
support as great scientists, but not as great communicators, in
particular in front of an audience. A communicator with an attitude is
the best tool in the hands of any opponent. While I do agree that most
scientists are exasperated by facepalming comments, distorted facts and
zealous morons, developing a strong attitude is completely
counterproductive.

**Root cause**: The human brain is a box filled with opinions. With 7
billions people in the world, humanity is a relevant statistical
ensemble where any particular mix of opinions is likely to exist
somewhere in someone's head right now. Someone will exists that won't
bulge regardless of any attempt to communicate even the most simple
facts. Also, most grown-up humans do not like to change idea, and do not
like to be proven or told they are wrong. Sticking to what their neural
network already contains is less demanding than readjusting it with a
new training set, eventually being proud of not knowing something.

**Mitigating options**: *"It is never socially acceptable to be proud of
your ignorance"* should be an important "take home message" to convey
when facing people with an attitude towards scientific culture. In these
cases, only carefully chosen peer pressure can promote something
positive: a broad hostile audience is only going to make things worse.
Nevertheless, I feel that even in the best conditions, no improvement
will be obtained. Remember that "haters gonna hate", and the message
won't get through, but it can get through in "lesser haters" also
participating in the debate.

When it comes to scientists with an attitude, positive assertiveness is
a much better strategy, instead of negative attitude. Sometimes it's
simply better to drop out of the conversation. Proper choice of the
audience, or supporting partners with positive assertiveness
characteristics is also a relevant strategy. The more attrition is
generated, the worse it is, and we don't want attrition. We are here to
explain this beautiful world.

Conclusions
-----------

I presented a set of five Factors that, in my opinion, affect the
communication to the general public when it comes to hard-science
research. I tried to convey an analysis of the Factors, as well as
possible mitigating options in order to improve the situation. I do
realize that most of what I propose is hardly feasible, but I think that
any food for thoughts is useful when discussing scientific
dissemination.

To conclude, I personally think that one simple thing should be always
remembered: provided no false promises are used, as long as you improve
the human condition for the better it does not matter what you do. Some
disciplines take minutes, some others take centuries. However, science
is really the only tool we have to provide factual answers and working
solutions on how the universe works, how to improve our lifestyle and
health, how to mitigate adverse effects from cruel natural events. We
are working for humanity, but humanity needs to know it properly.
