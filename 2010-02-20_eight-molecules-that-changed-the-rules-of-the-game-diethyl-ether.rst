Eight molecules that changed the rules of the game: Diethyl Ether

With this post I want to start a series about single molecules whose
synthesis, discovery, or explanation had such dramatic effects for
humanity to produce a complete paradigm shift for daily life or
scientific insight. On purpose, I left out the "big ones": you will not
find DNA in this list, nor you will find vitamins. Instead, I will focus
on small, apparently insignificant compounds of a handful of atoms,
whose legacy is so pervasive that we cannot imagine a world without it.

So... here we go.

Diethyl Ether
=============

**Rule changed: started the formal discipline of anesthesia**
-------------------------------------------------------------

Diethyl Ether, also simply known as ether, chemical formula
CH3-CH2-O-CH2-CH3, is not a particularly pleasant compound at first
sight: it is highly flammable, with tendencies of explosiveness, toxic
in high doses, and with an unpleasant, suffocating smell... but in fact
it is a really precious substance.

Ether was the breakthrough that started the formal discipline of
anesthesia. Before 1842, having a surgery or a tooth extraction was
synonymous with excruciating, horrible pain. There was basically no
reliable anesthetic available. Traditional methods against pain were
based on either alcohol, opium, `mixtures of herbs <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanaoka_Seish%C5%AB#Ts.C5.ABsensan>`_
or similar drugs, all suboptimal: their effect is difficult to control,
sometimes partial, and often dangerous in the required dose. In the
first half of the 19th century, not many candidates were available as
potential anesthetics.

Known and synthesized hundreds of year earlier, ether was not the only
substance known to demonstrate anesthetic properties. Chloroform,
chemical formula CHCl3 is another one, but it is strongly toxic.
Improperly used, it is fatal. A better compound was known to be `Nitrous Oxide <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide>`_, chemical formula
N2O, and also known as "laughing gas"

Produced for the first time in 1775 by `Joseph Priestley <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Priestley>`_, this
colorless, harmless and slightly sweet gas did not receive much
attention until `Humphry Davy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphry_Davy>`_, aged 21, decided to
take a sniff... you know, as an experiment. The result: tingling
sensation, sensitivity to sounds, hallucinations, and a very pleasant
euphoria. In the spirit of scientific sharing, in particular when you
are 21 and science gives you the air of paradise, big public parties
were organized. People got inebriated and apparently had a good time, so
good that N2O became a de-facto alternative to alcohol. The distraction
perpetuated by the recreational use of nitrous oxide was so strong that
for more than 30 years nobody really took the time of using it as
anesthetic.

Around the same time, ether was used for the same activity: getting
high. There were some rumors of danger about it, so it remained less
popular than nitrous oxide, but regardless of the rumors some people, in
the US so-called "`ether frolics <http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0CE6D71131EE3ABC4052DFB766838B699FDE>`_",
continued using it. Among them was a 17 years old student, Philip
Wilhite. Not what we would call a kind person: while getting inebriated
with friends, they forced a passing-by black guy to breathe large
quantities of ether. The poor guy fell completely unconscious, and only
after an hour or so and much slapping by the local doctor he was able
to, I assume, run away on his legs from that bunch of criminals.

In 1842, Wilhite became assistant for `Crawford Long <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawford_Long>`_, a doctor and
surgeon. Apparently, it was not unusual for Long's team to throw wild
ether parties, where it was also not uncommon to get bruises due to the
ether-induced tumbling and falling. The realization that no memory
remained about the bruises, together with Wilhite experience with the
poor black guy years earlier, made them realize they found something
interesting. They performed the first dental surgery under anesthesia,
to remove a tumor, and it was successful, but they did not publish their
findings until 1848, although Long openly demonstrated his findings to
other colleagues.

In the meantime, `Horace Wells <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Wells>`_, a dentist,
pioneered the use of nitrous oxide during dental surgery. Unfortunately,
the process did not work during a crucial presentation at the
Massachusetts General Hospital , and Wells was strongly derided by the
audience. He ended up living in shame until he took his own life while
in jail. However, his disappointing result set the stage for the success
of his former associate, `William Morton <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_T._G._Morton>`_, in 1846.

Morton, a dentist as well (although he never graduated), used ether for
his patients. Apparently, he got the idea from his tutor Charles
Jackson, from Wells, and hearing about the "ether frolics". He was
invited for a demonstration of his claims at the very same hospital
where Wells had his personal disgrace the year before, and successfully
excised a tumor without any sign of pain from the patient. Morton
claimed it was not using ether, but a substance he called "Letheon", for
which he applied a patent. Nobody believed him, as it was clear as
sunlight it was ether. He got many enemies, and he never really obtained
anything out of his efforts of getting money. He died poor at the
relatively young age of 49. Nevertheless, the buzz generated around the
issue was enough for him to be credited as the one who started
anesthesia.

Except that he wasn't. Crawford Long did it four years before him.
Today, Long (and partially Wilhite and the poor black guy) is recognized as the
person who started it all, but he did not receive a commemorative monument,
unlike Morton

Today, ether is no longer used as anesthetics, except in developing
countries where cost is a major factor, mainly because it's flammable,
slightly toxic, and better alternatives exist. On the other hand,
nitrous oxide is still used as mild anesthetic in dentistry.
Interestingly, the jury is still out on the mechanism behind the
anesthetic effect of these substances. After 150 years and all the
improvements in our scientific techniques, we still don't really know
what exactly happens when we inhale ether or nitrous oxide.
