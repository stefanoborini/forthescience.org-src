My business card, with QR-code. Geeky!

I ran out of business cards recently, so I had to make new ones. I took
the chance to indulge a bit over the
`QR-Code <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code>`_, a two-dimensional
barcode you can find **on everything** in Japan. It's a pretty nice
barcode system, very stable with respect to corruption and quite ok in
terms of capacity. Among many others, there's a library
(`ZebraCrossing <http://code.google.com/p/zxing/>`_) to encode and
decode QR-codes, and also online services are available for this (to
`decode <http://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx>`_ and
`encode <http://zxing.appspot.com/generator/>`_). `Google
charts <http://code.google.com/apis/chart/types.html#qrcodes>`_ can also
be used to encode.

Ok, it's not particularly stylish (I've never been good in design and
graphic arts), but it's definitely geeky! Since I am an artistically
impaired geek, this card represents me pretty well. The idea is that you
can take a picture of it (with your cellphone, for example) and with
proper software installed on the cellphone a vcard-like format (MECARD)
gets automatically imported in your contacts. The QR-Code contains
nothing more than the text on the card (with some omissions to stay
small). I'm pretty sure I'm not the first person having this gadget on
his business card, but I still haven't seen it on someone else's card.
