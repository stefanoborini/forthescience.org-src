**Rule changed: it started the world of plastic we live in**

`|Bakelite| <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bakelit_Struktur.png>`_

When it comes to materials for making tools, housing, chariots, and
dishes, humanity had only one choice for many thousands of years: use
what nature provided. Clay, rocks, metals, resins, rubber, and wood were
the most common materials directly available for harvesting. As
primitive technology improved, materials with new and interesting
properties were created, such as glass and concrete, but at that time
there was little or no understanding of the "magic" behind the process,
the new material's properties, or how to improve them, except by trial
and error. The discovery process improved considerably when the rules of
physics and chemistry were rationalized: the gained understanding of
existing natural materials made possible to design similar ones, either
partially or completely synthetic, endowed with unusual interesting
properties. One remarkable example of these man-made compounds is
**plastic**: discovered at the end of the 19th century, plastic
materials changed and still change the world.

Plastics are defined for their properties of being easy to shape,
extrude and cast; they belong to a much larger class of chemical
compounds called **polymers**, long molecules assembled from small,
simple, repeated components called monomers. The polymer class also
includes famous compounds such as DNA, RNA, proteins,
`Wood <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood>`_ (mainly composed by
`Lignin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignin>`_ and
`Cellulose <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose>`_), and `natural
rubber <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber>`_ (a polymer of
`isoprene <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoprene>`_).

Rubber is an interesting compound. It has positive qualities such as
strong resistance, flexibility and elasticity, but it also has
drawbacks, like being very sensitive to temperature: too hot, and it
becomes sticky; too cold, and it becomes fragile. With the recently
acquired chemical knowledge about matter and transformations, chemists
in the 19th century tried to modify natural rubber to improve its
characteristics.
`Vulcanization <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcanization>`_ (cooking
rubber with sulfur) was independently discovered by Friedrich Ludersdorf
and Nathaniel Hayward in 1834 as a method to improve its mechanical
properties. Some years later, first `Thomas
Hancock <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hancock_(inventor)>`_ then
`Charles Goodyear <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Goodyear>`_
improved the process, giving a strong impulse to production of tires for
the growing car industry.

`|Shellac
flakes| <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Shellac_varities.png>`_

Another interesting, all-natural material was
`Shellac <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac>`_, a resin produced by
an Indian bug, `Laccifer
lacca <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laccifer_lacca>`_, as a material for
its cocoon. Known since antiquity, it was clearly very expensive both
for production and logistics, but had a lot of nice properties,
including the possibility of being molded and shaped with additives,
such as pulverized wood. Finding a cheap replacement for Shellac became
one important objective for chemists at the end of the 19th century.

Partially man-made plastics: Parkesine, Viscose and Galalith
------------------------------------------------------------

The first partially man-made plastic to reach commercial status was
`Parkesine <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkesine>`_, produced by
`Alexander Parkes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Parkes>`_ in
1855 as a chemical modification of
`nitrocellulose <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose_nitrate>`_, in
itself a modification of natural cellulose with a process discovered
independently by `Henri
Braconnot <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Braconnot>`_,
`Théophile-Jules
Pelouze <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9ophile-Jules_Pelouze>`_,
`Christian Friedrich
Schönbein <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Friedrich_Sch%C3%B6nbein>`_,
and `Rudolf Christian
Böttger <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Christian_B%C3%B6ttger>`_.
Parkesine was a financial disaster, due to its poor physical properties:
fragile and prone to warp. In addition, industrial production was very
expensive. It took `John Wesley
Hyatt <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley_Hyatt>`_ to define a
better process (discovered by accident) and commercialize the product as
`celluloid <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celluloid>`_ in 1870.

Celluloid is thermoplastic: it can be heated, molded into a shape, then
cooled down to create the desired object, and this process can be
eventually repeated. It replaced ivory, turtle shell and bone, in
particular for the production of billiard balls, and it was also used as
a film support for the growing movie industry.

Unfortunately, `celluloid is highly
flammable <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose_nitrate>`_: from
exploding billiard balls to film catching fire during storage,
transportation and projection, handling celluloid always carried a
potential fire hazard. `Accidents reaping many lives
occurred <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Cinema_Disaster>`_.
Celluloid is still used today to produce ping pong balls.

Through a different modification of cellulose, `Louis Marie Hilaire
Bernigaut de
Chardonnet <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilaire_de_Chardonnet>`_
invented `Viscose <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscose>`_ in 1891 to
replace silk with an artificial fiber. The usual problem of flammability
was later solved (after actual accidents happened) by Charles Topham.
Further refinements to the process and formula by Cross, Bevan and
Beadle led to the commercial fiber known as Rayon. The same substance
was later used by Jacques Brandenberger to produce Cellophane.

`Galalith <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galalith>`_ was another
partially man-made plastic. It used a milk protein,
`casein <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casein>`_, combined with
formaldehyde. It has good properties, but it was mainly used for buttons
and jewelry, and in the long run it wasn't competitive in price and
production against crude oil-based plastics.

The first completely man-made plastic: Bakelite
-----------------------------------------------

The year is 1907. `Leo Hendrik
Baekeland <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Baekeland>`_, a native
Belgian emigrated to the United States, synthesizes and then presents to
the world the first polymeric compound produced from monomers, and not
from modification of pre-existing natural compounds. This polymer, which
he names `Bakelite <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakelite>`_, is the
first completely man-made polymer, and is going to become a life changer
whose legacy is everywhere around us.

Baekeland was a very proficient inventor. He moved to USA to continue
his studies and practice in chemistry. Among his first inventions was a
new, faster photographic paper whose rights were immediately bought by
Eastman Kodak. The large amount of money for the rights and the
production facility made Baekeland rich, and allowed him to push
chemical research forward. He wanted to explore in more details the
polymer world, to find a substitute for shellac.

Phenol[/caption]

Bakelite is obtained combining phenol (a derivative of benzene obtained
from coal tar) and formaldehyde (obtained from wood alcohol). These two
compounds react and create a highly ramified network, a
`phenol-formaldehyde
resin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenol_formaldehyde_resin>`_. To be
fair, Nobel prize winner `Adolf von
Baeyer <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_von_Baeyer>`_ got the
material already in 1872, more than 30 years earlier, but he did not get
the chance to refine the process, nor to make it a commercial product.
`Baeyer's student Werner Kleeberg and many others were even
closer <http://www.bakelitmuseum.de/e/bakges-e.htm>`_, but either they
were focusing on something else, or they didn't find the "sweet spot" to
produce a valuable product.

In fact, most of Baekeland research went into finding the right
temperature and pressure for the polymer to form with the proper
characteristics, stay in resin (liquid) form for as long as required,
and then poured into shapes so that it could harden. This is a vivid
example of comparison between pure research and industrial R&D.

Bakelite was totally revolutionary for the time: it can be mold into any
shape; it is an excellent electric insulator and had a considerable
heat-resistance; once solidified, it does not melt again; it is not
flammable, a killer feature compared to Cellulose; it accepts filler
material such as wood flour, for better properties and reduced cost; it
is light and resistant, an essential additional property for production
of weapons.

Initial uses of Bakelite were electrical insulation for industrial
connectors, but the real kick to Bakelite use came when the patent
expired in 1927: competitors took grip of the expired patent, prices
collapsed and new varieties and colors of Bakelite arose under the new
brand name of `Catalin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalin>`_, among
many others. Catalin had better quality and a wider range of colors,
making it ideal for the consumer-level market. The Swedish company
Ericcson made `telephones with
Bakelite <http://www.ericssonhistory.se/templates/Ericsson/Article.aspx?id=2095&ArticleID=3159&CatID=360&epslanguage=EN>`_
in 1931. `Jewels made of Bakelite were
created <http://www.ehow.com/about_6385871_history-bakelite-jewelry.html>`_
and endorsed as new fashion objects. It replaced the very expensive
ivory for `poker
chips <http://www.mademan.com/mm/history-bakelite-poker-chips.html>`_
and billiard balls. It dropped production costs, allowing radios and
many common house tools to become more common. `The list of products
made of Bakelite/Catalin is almost
endless <http://www.amsterdambakelitecollection.com/collection.php>`_.

New plastic materials are synthesized
-------------------------------------

Following Bakelite, the chemical industry discovered and produced a
myriad of new plastic materials, or found innovative uses for previously
known compounds. Commercial and technical brands quickly entered the
layperson vocabulary: Lucite, Plexiglas, Rayon, Cellophane, Nylon,
Neoprene, Styrene-Butadiene Rubber (SBR), PVC, Teflon, Polyethylene,
Polycarbonate, PET. If you look around you, chances are that you will
find one or more of these compounds, either for a bottle, for
kitchenware, in some parts of your car, or in your clothes. In some
cases, the strange and intriguing properties of a plastic material made
it nothing but a toy, but an incredibly successful one: `Silly
Putty <http://forthescience.org/blog/2009/11/14/non-newtonian-fluids/>`_.

Today, plastic is the most used material in the world, and research
focus shifted to other important requirements. We discovered that some
plastics can be used to `produce
electricity <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer_solar_cell>`_,
`conduct
electricity <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductive_polymer>`_,
`accumulate
electricity <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_polymer_battery>`_,
`convert electricity into
light <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_LED>`_, `transport
light <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_optical_fiber>`_, `purify
water from organic sludge <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolyDADMAC>`_ or
from `poisonous metallic
ions <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion-exchange_resin>`_.

We realized that in general, plastic is not easily degraded by the
environment, and it remains unscathed for a long time. This produces
very unpleasant situations for our planet's ecosystem, and consequently
to us: the `Great Pacific Garbage
Patch <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch>`_ is an
accumulation of mainly plastic pollutants, converged in central Pacific
by the `oceanic gyre <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_gyre>`_, as
`beautifully and sadly depicted in this short
movie <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDBtCb61Sd4>`_.

Some plastics have been designed to be `quickly degraded by
environmental
bacteria <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradable_plastic>`_,
although to be fair it can introduce a whole new sets of problems. The
most responsible strategy is to recycle as much as possible.
