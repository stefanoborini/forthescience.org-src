:slug: about

My name is Stefano Borini. I have a Ph.D. in quantum chemistry from Ferrara
University, Ferrara, Italy, and Paul Sabatier University, Toulouse, France. My
Ph.D. work focused on two ab-initio techniques (the use of the perturbative
method NEVPT and the development of the localized orbital approach
Freeze-and-Cut) and their integration in a common software infrastructure. To
satisfy these needs, also part of my work was the definition and implementation
of a file format for data exchange in quantum chemistry, Q5Cost.

After my Ph.D. I shifted my focus toward scientific programming, being employed
both in industry and academia. In particular I worked on Density Functional
Theory on crystalline systems and electronic transport, graph theory, data
model design (at Atomistix, now `QuantumWise <http://www.quantumwise.com/>`_),
Comparative Genomics, bioinformatics databases, book authoring (at `Center for
Biological Sequence Analysis <http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/>`_ at the Technical
University of Denmark), optical properties of conjugated compounds and RDF
databases for computational chemistry data (at `ETH ZÃ¼rich
<http://www.ethz.ch/>`_, Switzerland and `National Institute of Informatics
<http://www.nii.ac.jp/index.php?action=pages_view_main&page_id=59&lang=english>`_,
Tokyo, Japan), Tight Binding DFT (at `Scientific Computing and Modelling
<http://www.scm.com/About/AboutPersonnel>`_ in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and
Jacobs University Bremen, Germany).

I am currently employed at `QuantumWise <http://www.quantumwise.com/>`_ A/S,
Copenhagen, Denmark, where I am an all-round scientific software specialist and
developer, mainly focusing on MacOSX, builds, hardcore debugging, design, and
GUI programming with Qt.

My strong skills are in code refactoring and reviewing, debugging, file
formats, GUI usability, software design, computational chemistry, and
scientific writing. I always welcome new opportunities to learn and increase my
competences. I enjoy programming in many languages, with my favorite being
Python. My operating systems of choice are MacOSX and Linux.

I like simple things, enjoy nature, an afternoon with a friend and a cup of
tea. And I like to do things for the science.
