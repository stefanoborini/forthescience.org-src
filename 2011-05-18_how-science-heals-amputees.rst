Check out this great movie on the BBC website: a young amputee decided
to replace his non-functional hand with a robotic one. `The new hand
allows him to perform tasks as tying a shoe, opening a bottle, and fully
rotate around the wrist <http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-13378036>`_,
something not possible for a human hand. This is impressive on so many
levels. The future is here. Cue Star Wars music.
