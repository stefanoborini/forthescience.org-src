Restyling!

I decided to restyle the blog a bit. Images and design are from the
following websites and people, which I gratefully thank

-  Green icons under CC-SA from `craigsoup.com <http://craigsoup.com>`_.
   Personalized with `Inkscape <http://www.inkscape.org/>`_ and `the
   Gimp <http://gimp-app.sourceforge.net/>`_.
-  Book image in the Bookshelf: openclipart public domain image from
   `msgloan <http://openclipart.org/media/people/mgsloan>`_.
-  Theme `Mix <http://www.jauhari.net/free-wordpress-theme-mix.jsp>`_ by
   Jauhari Nurudin from `Sandbox competition <http://www.sndbx.org/>`_

The restyling is not done yet. I will add more credits to this post if I
will use more third party productions.
