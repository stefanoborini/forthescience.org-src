Nothing new under the Sun, but the very interesting presentation makes
it very cool to see. I just got to `this article at BBC about the Top500
supercomputer
list <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/10187248.stm>`_, where a
very nice `Treemap graph <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping>`_
presents supercomputers according to their computational power. By
selecting the Operating System, the dominance of Linux is staggering,
confirming its status of de-facto standard for high-performance
computing. Again, nothing new under the Sun, but it is interesting to
see it in such strong visual representation.
