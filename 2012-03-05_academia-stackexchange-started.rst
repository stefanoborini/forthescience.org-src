More than `a year
ago <http://forthescience.org/blog/2010/08/06/new-stackexchange-proposal-academia/>`_,
I decided to propose a Question/Answer site for Academia on the
StackExchange platform. The idea was to gather academics to share their
expertise in academic career strategies, grant proposals, publication
process, visa and immigration for academics, and generally all the
troubles of an academic lifestyle.

A few days ago, the site finally reached the threshold commitment, went
through private beta, and is now `open to the public in beta
stage <http://academia.stackexchange.com/>`_. It is now possible to join
in and ask questions or give answers.
