Except for its nice regular hexagonal shape, benzene is not a nice
compound. It is toxic, carcinogen, highly flammable, burns with a very
dirty and smoky flame, and if it is not enough, it made chemists go
crazy for one hundred years. The latter point is interesting for our
discussion. Why, you may ask ? It has to do with its structure and a
bunch of data that didn't add up for quite a long time, starting from
its discovery, in 1825. It took more than one hundred years to finally
understand what was going on, and it required the development of a whole
new scientific discipline: quantum chemistry.

Our story begins when chemistry was a very smelly, messy and toxic
affair (it still is, but we are more careful). At that time, there was
no electron, the concept of bond just started to appear in the
literature, even atomic weights were wrong: carbon was assumed to weight
6 daltons instead of the correct 12, hence all the formulas were
computed to have twice as much carbon. No wonder nobody could figure
anything out.

The discovery of benzene and its strange behavior
-------------------------------------------------

Benzene, also known as benzol, was first isolated by `Michael
Faraday <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Faraday>`_ by boiling
crude oil and condensating the obtained vapors, a procedure known as
distillation. The same compound was subsequently found in `coal
tar <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_tar>`_ , and produced from some
vegetal resins. Due to its characteristic smell, chemists declared
benzene as the opener of the newly minted class of aromatic compounds.

When something new was isolated in the 19th century, the first thing
chemists did was to burn it and gather the combustion products, to
derive its composition. The process, known as `combustion
analysis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion_analysis>`_ was one of
the very few tools available at the time to understand the internal
nature of substances; it exploits the fact that atoms are not created
nor destroyed, but just moved around to create new molecules (the
so-called `Lavoisier rule of conservation of
mass <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_mass>`_). Benzene was
clearly thrown into the ordeal, and after a bit of math, the resulting
rate between carbon atoms vs. hydrogen atoms was found to be 1:1 (the
`empirical formula <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_formula>`_),
that is, there was one hydrogen atom for each carbon atom. Additional
experiments determined the `molecular
formula <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_formula>`_ to be C6H6. A
good start, but nothing was said about how the atoms were arranged
together, the `structural
formula <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_formula>`_. Here the
problems began to accumulate.

In stable, "normal" molecules, carbon connects with four other atoms via
single bonds. Eventually, it can connect to the same atom with double or
triple bonds, but the total number of bonds has to be four. This was
acquired but still not settled knowledge when benzene was investigated.
Chemists knew the double bond between two carbon atoms was quite
reactive, and glad to open to become a single bond while adding
something else to the remaining opened bond. This reaction is known as
`addition <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition_reaction>`_:

Benzene did not behave anything like that. It was assumed there were
double bonds because the amount of hydrogen was very low, but it was
incredibly inert, and did not perform the addition reaction. Instead, it
performed an unusual reaction, substitutions. On top of this, more weird
facts: when something was attached to it only one product was obtained,
as if only one carbon was accepting the new appendage, or as if all
carbons were equivalent. However, if two molecular groups were attached,
*three* products were obtained! Gathering all this strange behavior, the
problem now was to find a structure satisfying all the facts.

A quest for the structure
-------------------------

Trying to make sense to all these data, `Freidrich
Kekulé <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_August_Kekul%C3%A9_von_Stradonitz>`_
proposed in 1865 a hexagonal structure, where carbon atoms were
connected via alternated double and single bonds, with the remaining
bonds connecting to hydrogens.

The circular structure was not, however, whole Kekulé invention.
`Similar proposals were made <http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/rzepa/loschmidt/>`_
by `Joseph Loschmidt <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Loschmidt>`_
in 1861, but from his notes it is difficult to say if he really meant
it. `Archibald
Couper <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Scott_Couper>`_ had
similar insights even earlier, in 1858, but a `nervous breakdown arising
from unfair
treatment <http://www.chemheritage.org/classroom/chemach/chemsynthesis/couper-kekule.html>`_
put him out of scientific activity.

Alternative structures were proposed by
`Claus <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Karl_Ludwig_Claus>`_ (`Claus
benzene, which cannot
exist <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus%27_benzene>`_) in 1867,
`Dewar <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dewar>`_ (`Dewar
benzene <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewar_benzene>`_, which can be
produced, but it is highly unstable) in the same year, and
`Prismane <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prismane>`_, proposed by
`Ladenburg <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ladenburg>`_ in 1869.
The proposal made by Kekulé appeared the most likely to be correct. It
explained the single product when something was added to it

.. image:: http://forthescience.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/benzene_single_substition.png

as you can see, it does not matter where X is added. All carbons are
equivalent, because if you substitute, say, on carbon 2, you can just
rotate the molecule and make it overlap exactly with the one shown.

It also explained the three products when two groups were added

.. image:: http://forthescience.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/benzene_double_substition.png

these three structures are different, and are therefore three totally
different products. One objection, however, quickly arised: if you have
X on carbons 1 and 2, and X on carbon 1 and 6, rotate the second
molecule and try to make them overlap by renumbering the atoms, they are
not the same compound. In the first case they embrace a double bond, and
in the second case, a single bond

According to logic and what was known, these two molecules were
different, thus not matching the "three products" fact. Kekulé solved
this fallacy of his model by stating that the two structures quickly
interconverted one into the other, so you could not see the difference.
He was not that far from the truth, but he was wrong nevertheless.

More evidence does not add up
-----------------------------

Time passes, and we are now well into the 20th century. More evidence at
the same time both confirmed and did not match the Kekulé model. For
example, if you take a compound with a double bond, say, ethylene, and
make it react with hydrogen (treating it very badly in a high
temperature reactor)

CH\ :sub:`2`\ =CH\ :sub:`2`\  + H\ :sub:`2`\  ->
CH\ :sub:`3`\ -CH\ :sub:`3`\  + Energy

the double bond disappears and you get ethane and some energy. Let's
call this amount of energy E. Repeat the same for a compound with two
double bonds, and you get two times E. With three double bonds? You get
three times E. This makes sense. What it didn't make sense was the fact
that performing the same operation on benzene (which had, apparently,
three double bonds) did not give three times X. It gave much less! It
was like one double bond did not exist. The stable, inert and unusual
behavior for a compound made of all those double bonds was baffling. At
least it was found that forcefully adding hydrogen to benzene produced
cyclohexane, confirming the fact that it was indeed circular.

Another problem arose when X-ray technologies allowed to measure the
length of the bonds between atoms. In non-benzene molecules,
Carbon-Carbon double bonds were found to be shorter (134 picometers)
than single bonds (154 picometers). This would have produced a distorted
hexagon, with short sides (for double bonds) and long sides (for single
bonds). The measures performed on benzene were unambiguous: the
carbon-carbon bonds were all the same length: 139 picometers, a measure
in between a Carbon-Carbon double bond and a single bond.

It took `Linus Pauling <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling>`_
with the concept of
`resonance <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance_%28chemistry%29>`_,
and the work of many famous theoretical chemists such as
`Hückel <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_H%C3%BCckel>`_ (with the
`method <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCckel_method>`_ and
`rule <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCckel%27s_rule>`_ named after
him) to explain what was going on: simplifying a lot, benzene does not
have double bonds and single bonds. It has bonds that are all the same,
and are a "mixture", an intermediate between a single and a double bond.
Resonance is the phenomenon that allows mixing of two or more molecular
structures (called resonance structures) to define a much better
representation of reality: a resonance hybrid. Resonance displaced the
concept of "rapid interconversion" of structures defined by Kekulé. The
benzene bonds were not rearranging quickly from single to double and
vice-versa. They were something in between!

We can make this strange phenomenon more clear with a (slightly crazy)
comparison against a real-world situation: if you inbreed a horse and a
donkey what you obtain is a mule, which is an animal in its own right
and is a mixture of the two original animals. The mule can be seen as a
resonance hybrid defined by the donkey and the horse resonance
structures. Thinking in Kekulé terms, we would say the mule spends half
of its existence as a horse, and the other half as a donkey, quickly
transforming from one to the other, which is not the case.

The concept of resonance also explained the perfect hexagonal shape of
benzene: each bond is not single nor double; it is instead a mixture
whose length is intermediate between the two, and each bond has exactly
the same length. It also explained the unusual stability of benzene: the
electrons are not concentrated between specific atoms (which makes them
more likely to engage in a reaction). Resonance spread them on a larger,
uniform and diffuse ring, with the consequence of reduced reactivity. Be
warned though, this is a strong simplification. A proper explanation
would require some math.

The legacy
----------

The concept of resonance pushed organic, inorganic, theoretical and
computational chemistry into a completely different realm of
understanding. It explains with ease many apparently puzzling chemical
reactions, as well as the properties of molecules in terms of stability,
optical properties (for example, their color) and interaction with other
molecules. It explained why the black stick you have inside your pencil
(graphite, which is pure carbon) conducts electricity and is black,
while the shiny, expensive rock you find on engagement rings (diamond,
again pure carbon) is totally non-conductive and transparent. It allowed
to further develop our understanding of molecular reactivity, so that we
can now synthesize complex compounds such as graphene, fullerene, and
nanotubes, all made from the hexagonal unit benzene, repeated again and
again.

As for benzene itself, it is so central to our current lifestyle that
living without it is hard to imagine. Benzene is in fact the starting
point for the production of drugs, plastics, detergents, pesticides,
paints, dyes, rubber, explosives, as an additive to fuel, and as a
solvent. Considering that most benzene is produced from oil, we can see
how a shortage of crude oil can have a major impact on many different
aspects of our life.
