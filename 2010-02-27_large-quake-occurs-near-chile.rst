A magnitude 8.8 quake occurred in Chile. A tsunami warning has been
issued. Very good details, and a map of the predicted height of the
tsunami across all the pacific can be found at `Phil Plait's
blog <http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/02/27/magnitude-8-8-earthquake-off-chile-coast/>`_.

Apparently, Japan is not concerned about the Tsunami, which should hit
around 3 AM GMT (12AM Japanese time). The advisories from the `Japanese
meteo/quake agency <http://www.jma.go.jp/en/tsunami/>`_ has no
information about any critical measures to be taken.

Yesterday, a `weaker but still relevant
quake <http://www.jma.go.jp/en/quake/20100227053734491-270531.html>`_
hit the island of Okinawa, in the south of the Japanese Archipelago.
