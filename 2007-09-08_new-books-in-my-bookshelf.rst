I just added two new books in my bookshelf: `Refactoring Databases:
Evolutionary Database
Design <http://www.amazon.co.uk/Refactoring-Databases-Evolutionary-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321293533>`_
and `The Mythical Man Month and Other Essays on Software
Engineering <http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mythical-Month-Essays-Software-Engineering/dp/0201835959>`_.

I am currently reading the latter. There are very valid reasons for this
book to be a classic. It provides a great description on how real-world
project management works, and which are the important steps and
strategies to cope with well known mistakes and issues during
development of large systems. It is very broad, never too specific, but
it is full of insights. A mind-opening book I strongly suggest.
