		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today we will talk about energy, and the scale of it when it comes to consumption and production. In case you haven't realized, we are running out of oil, therefore it is important to have a clear measure of how much we consume with our daily life, and plan accordingly.

One important notion we need to acquire before delving into the comparison is the difference between energy, power, and the units commonly used to measure them. There's a lot of confusion about it.

<strong>Energy</strong> is what you consume to do some work. Energy does not spring out of nowhere. You cannot create it, you cannot destroy it. All our life, and our universe, transform energy from one form into another. You use <strong>chemical energy</strong> obtained from your food to lift a stone from the ground, thus converting this chemical energy into <strong>potential energy</strong>, an energy associated to the height from the ground. When the stone it is left falling, this potential energy becomes <strong>kinetic energy</strong> (which is the energy associated with movement) and finally becomes <strong>thermal energy</strong> when the stone finally reaches the soil and heats up the pavement. The end result of this operation is that you converted a well defined quantity of chemical energy from your food into a well defined quantity of thermal energy of the ground and the stone, and this amount of energy is also equal to the potential energy the stone had before falling and the amount of kinetic energy it had before coming to an abrupt stop wit the soil. Nothing gets created, nothing gets destroyed. This energy can be quantified exactly.

<strong>Power</strong> is the rate of consumption or production of energy with respect to time. If you consume 100 units of energy in 20 seconds, your energy consumption per second (and thus your power) is 5.
<h2>Watts and Watthours. What's the difference?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>To move into a more detailed explanation of the units actually used to talk about energy and power, we need to strike out a simple comparison first. Most of us are familiar with space, time, and speed. When your car goes at a <strong>speed</strong> of 50 kilometers per hour (km/h), it means that in the <strong>time</strong> of one hour it will travel a <strong>space</strong> of 50 kilometers. For two hours, the car will travel 100 km and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you ever heard about sailing and cruise ships, you may know that they measure speed in knots. Space, on the other hand, is measured in nautical miles, and time in hours. There's a parallelism we can draw. See table</p>

<table style="text-align: left; width: 500px; height: 85px;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">Amount (Space)</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Time</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Rate (Speed)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>kilometer</td>
<td>hour</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">kilometers/hour</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>nautical mile</td>
<td>hour</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">nautical miles/hour = knots</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
In this table, we see that in seafaring, there's a well defined name for the speed: they don't say I go at 10 nautical miles/hour, they say I go 10 knots. How do you get the space traveled, knowing that you sailed for 3 hours at 10 knots ? That's easy: 10 knots * 3 hours = 30 nautical miles, but you may also say 30 "knothours", as a whole word. It would be exactly the same as nautical miles, although nobody uses it in reality. <strong>knothours is a measure of space traveled</strong>. Knots is a measure of rate of space traveled with respect to time.

This is a good moment to introduce the units for energy and power. Energy is like space in our example above. Power is like speed. Power is traditionally measured in <strong>Watts</strong> (which matches knots in our correspondence above), a unit you normally find everywhere, and commonly well found on lamps. Like a boat traveling at 10 knots for 3 hours does 30 knothours, if you use a lamp that consumes 10 watts for 3 hour you consume 30 watthours of energy.
<table style="text-align: left; width: 501px; height: 127px;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">Amount</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Time</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Rate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>kilometer</td>
<td>hour</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">kilometers/hour</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>nautical mile orÂ  <strong>knothour</strong></td>
<td>hour</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">knot</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>watthour</td>
<td>hour</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">watts</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Most people (including myself for some time) confuses "watthour" with "watts per hour (watt/hour)" drawing a parallel with "kilometers per hour (kilometers/hour)" but it's totally wrong. Also, another deceiving and confusing phrase is the following "this lamp consumes 50 watts". Technically, it consumes 50 <strong>watthours</strong> if it runs for one hour. A better phrase would be "this lamp consumption rate is 50 watts". Compare the phrase with similar incorrect wording having the same meaning for our examples above

<td>this lamp consumes 50 watts</td>
<td>this lamp's<strong> consumption rate</strong> is 50 watts</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Since you turned it on two hours ago, this lamp consumed 100 watthours of energy</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td style="text-align: left;">Since our departure two hours ago, we moved 100 kilometers</td>

</table>
Summing up:
<ul>
	<li><strong>watthour</strong> is an amount of energy (i.e. the stuff we use to do work)</li>
	<li><strong>watt </strong>is the speed of consumption (or production) of energy.</li>
</ul>
Yes, energy is conventionally measured in another unit, the joule, but I won't give any additional details about the joule. For our purposes, watthours are a well understandable unit for energy, and they allow us to do simple calculations like
<ul>
	<li>You have 100 watthours of energy available, and a device consumes 20 watts. For how much time can you keep it on ? 5 hours.</li>
	<li>You want a lamp that, when kept on all day and night, consumes no more than 100 watthours of energy. What is the maximum power allowed ? 4.16 watts.</li>
	<li>How much energy does my 50 watts lamp consumes in 3 hours ? 150 watthours.</li>
</ul>
Clearly, given the power (for example 50 W), the energy consumed or produced in one hour is the exact same numerical value, but in watthour (50 Wh)
<h2>Scale of energies</h2>
Now that we hopefully have a better understanding of the units, let's start appreciating some scale of energy consumed, produced or stored.
