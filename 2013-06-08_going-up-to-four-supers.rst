Going up to four supers

Last week, we added another super to the training hive, bringing the
total to four supers. Two are brood, and two are honey, with a queen
separator in the middle.

We found the queen in the second super. Brood was present and well
developed, and the family was healthy and extremely large. I've never
seen so many bees all at once.

As usual, we checked for signs of varroa in the drone cells. The larvae
seem to be really clean. I am surprised at how low the prevalence of
varroa is in these hives. In my previous school hive, varroa mites were
present, although in a very limited number. Here, I've seen only one,
dead mite on the bottom plate.

With temperatures relatively high, it was useful to remove the bottom
plate from the hive. This improves air circulation. The hive is in a
sheltered, well ventilated position, yet it's good care of the bees, and
better for honey production: high temperatures in the hive will force
the foragers to look for water, instead of nectar.
