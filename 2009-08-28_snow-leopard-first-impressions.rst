Snow Leopard first impressions

I just installed Snow Leopard, MacOSX 10.6, on my laptop.

It is indeed much faster. Considerably faster. I don't have actual
measures, but you can appreciate it. The interface is much snappier in
response. There are many tiny improvements around, minor things, nothing
revolutionary, although I really appreciate the new Expose': now you can
recall specific windows from the dock while in Expose' mode.

Problems?

-  Some strange change of font in some application
-  Unusual behavior from the Logitech control center (for my mouse),
   which pretends to quit and restart the System Preferences dialog
   every time I access it. This is due to the fact that the new System
   Preferences is by default in 64 bit mode. The Logitech control center
   is in 32bit mode, so System Preferences must relaunch itself in 32
   bit mode to access it. Click on the ? in the appearing dialog to get
   a hint on how to solve this issue.
-  Apparently, the Logitech control center does not play nicely with
   Snow Leopard, but you can tweak it a bit to your needs. Expose'
   access via mouse operations does not work anymore.
-  Another unusual event was the removal of development utilities. After
   the upgrade, make was gone, so I had to install XCode and the
   development utilities.
-  Inkscape does not work anymore.
-  NeoOffice 3.0 does not run, unless you install patch-7.
-  Cyberduck does not work anymore. Does not even pop up. Updating did
   not solve. I don't know if it's a problem of Snow Leopard or some
   setup issue on my side.

Considering the very affordable price, and the increase in performance,
it's definitely worth the upgrade. The troubles I am facing are,
however, not trivial to workaround.
