The kind folks behind `StackOverflow <http://www.stackoverflow.com>`_, a
free Question/Answers website for programming questions, recently
decided to open new Q/A websites for many additional interesting topics,
from wine tasting and cooking to mathematics. The fundamental requisite
for such new sites to be opened is a rather strict community review and
development of a critical mass of contributors and interested people. On
`area51.stackexchange.com <http://area51.stackexchange.com>`_ the
proposals are collected and evaluated by the community.

I really enjoyed the proposal for a `Popular Science Q/A
site <http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/4955/popular-natural-science?referrer=vWk93EAtW0d3hJ0vc5L2Fg2>`_,
and if the site is going to be opened, I will certainly be an active
contributor. If you are interested, feel free to click on the link and
then click "follow" on the proposal. This will largely increase the
chances for such site to be opened. I am also positively interested and
enthusiast for Q/A sites for
`Chemistry <http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/4964/chemistry?referrer=vpok596Q5s_I9B5m78vbHg2>`_,
`Astronomy <http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/51/astronomy?referrer=bHas6gOZ0iw1>`_,
`Bioinformatics <http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/6729/bioinformatics?referrer=s_EH-bQ39bHokx68A-kliQ2>`_
and, as a very old Dungeons and Dragons player, `Role-Playing
Games <http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/2208/role-playing-games?referrer=dqVlLVTOkX6U41zfK7oIpw2>`_.
