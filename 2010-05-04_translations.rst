Translations!

I decided to add a rather demanding additional requirement to my
blogging activities: I added multiple language support. From now on,
posts will also be available in Italian, by selecting the proper option
on the top-right corner of the page.

I will not post only when both translations are available. Instead, I
will continue blogging in English and progressively translate bottom-up
the English posts, until I catch my current flow. Under no circumstances
I will delay a post in order to get it in both languages. It would
become too demanding. I will keep translating efforts for low
inspiration times. This post, however, represents an exception. It is in
both languages from the start.
