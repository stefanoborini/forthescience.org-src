`Some time ago, I proposed the foundation of a Question and Answer site
for
Academia <http://forthescience.org/blog/2010/08/06/new-stackexchange-proposal-academia/>`_.
Now, the Academia StackExchange has reached commitment phase, meaning
that the proposal aggregated a consistent number of people who may have
an interest in it, and further aggregation of active participant is
sought after. You may report your interest in asking or answering at
least 10 question as soon as the site enter beta phase by following the
link to the `Academia StackExchange
Commitment <http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/16617/academia?referrer=uVR2liuBPBj7_uTkKsMvLw2>`_.

I really loved some of the comments from early committers, such as

-  *"I hope this site will help beginners to initiate their careers in
   academia, dispel myths to outsiders, and support fellow academics
   too!"* -
   `CesarGon <http://area51.stackexchange.com/users/20808/cesargon>`_
-  *"Should help out those who want to start their scientific research
   careers, especially for the ones with limited access to quality
   research education."* -
   `Kit <http://area51.stackexchange.com/users/16257/kit>`_
-  *"There is a great opportunity for young and idealistic people who
   want to change the world to receive good doses of reality checks and
   inspiration."* - so true
   `user30906 <http://area51.stackexchange.com/users/30906/user30906>`_,
   so true

and this one which made me laugh

-  *"Whatever Stefano Borini is involved in is probably worth looking
   into :)"* -
   `Dr\_bitz <http://area51.stackexchange.com/users/20025/dr-bitz>`_

We will see. The jump start is promising!
