As you probably heard in the news, `Craig
Venter <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Venter>`_, the American
biologist best known for starting up Celera Genomics and sequencing the
human genome, achieved another big success. He created a fully working
new bacterium, programming its DNA from scratch.

Like a computer having hardware and software, a bacterium has a set of
components that execute the software written in the DNA to create
proteins. For quite some time, the strategy was to put small pieces of
new DNA into full genomes, so to add a new piece of genetic code to
synthesize a new protein, typically a pharmaceutical drug. For example,
people with diabetes must periodically use insulin, a small protein
which is normally produced by a fully functional pancreas. If the
pancreas does not produce insulin, then diabetes arises. A solution is
to inject insulin from outside, but this small protein must be produced
somehow. The technique used to produce it is the `Recombinant
DNA <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA#Synthetic_insulin_production_using_recombinant_DNA>`_:
A small piece of DNA specifying the code to produce insulin was inserted
into a normal bacterium (Escherichia coli, the same that lives in your
gut). The altered bacterium duplicates, and millions and millions of
daughter cells now produce the proteins their genetic code specifies
for, like they were small chemical laboratories. Since specification for
insulin has been introduced in their DNA, these millions cells also
produce the precious insulin, which is then extracted, purified and sold
for diabetes treatment.

At the Craig Venter Institute, they went further. They didn't add
something new to a bacterium. They took all the DNA contained in one,
throw it in the dumpster, put another DNA completely designed on a
computer, and let it go. This has been done some time ago, but this
artificial bacterium was not able to reproduce, until some time ago.
Yesterday the paper has been finally published on Science: "`Creation of
a Bacterial Cell Controlled by a Chemically Synthesized
Genome <http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/science.1190719>`_",
marking the fact that the hardware (the mechanism that synthesize
proteins) can be programmed at will by totally replacing the software
(the DNA). In the most superior example of computer programming skills,
the JCVI now controls a chemical computer. Venter `walks the path of
Wohler <http://forthescience.org/blog/2010/04/20/eight-molecules-that-changed-the-rules-of-the-game-urea/>`_,
once again demonstrating that life has nothing magic, but it is just a
chemical system, obeying the rules of chemistry in a fascinating
self-sustaining, self-replicating system made of order and chaos.

What are the consequences of this achievement? What can we do with a
totally programmable, reproductive chemical laboratory ? Well, it's not
that easy. Actually this achievement is great, a milestone that will
probably earn Craig Venter the Nobel Prize very soon, but to go from
this achievement to practical uses for humankind we are a bit far,
although not that much far. Having such control will allow so endless
possibilities that are almost difficult to imagine right now in their
completeness, but we can start from:

#. production of now expensive proteins to cure diseases, similar to the
   insulin case, reducing the cost and increasing the effectiveness of
   therapies.
#. production of bacterial species able to consume and transform
   substances that are toxic for us
#. bacterial species able to deliver a pharmacological payload near the
   source of the disease. Today we inject stuff in our body, for example
   to kill cancer, but we poison every single cell, even the good ones.
   What if a bacterial species is able to detect and attach to a tumor,
   and then start producing an anticancer drug right there ?
#. `production of electricity from biological
   sources <http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=16921&a=f>`_.
   Take wood or sugar, let bacteria digest it and promote electricity
   creation (a so-called `microbial fuel
   cell <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbial_fuel_cell>`_). It's
   clean, renewable and easy to control. We already do something similar
   with `Biosensors <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosensor>`_ to
   evaluate the amount of glucose in blood.
#. production of biofuels from garbage or pollutant, like used plastic.
#. understand how a simple system like a bacterium works will give us
   the chance to understand more complex systems

Yes, some will probably be scared at the idea of such inane level of
control: biological weapons, superbugs... danger! danger!... but if you
really stop for a moment, check some history, and think deep, you
realize that biological warfare is nothing new: people in the middle
ages threw corpses hit by plague beyond castle walls to kill the
opponents via biological warfare; humanity does not need to create a
powerful bacterium as a weapon: a large amount of them are already
available in nature, ready to be harvested, and they could go straight
on the tip of some rocket ! Being scared that this new technology could
be used by mad, aggressive people as a weapon is not an issue. Again:
the biological weapon is already out there, since the very beginning.
This is the reason why biological weapon stockpiling and production has
been banned since 1972 (`Biological Weapon
Convention <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_Weapons_Convention>`_)
and only defensive research is allowed and pursued.

In fact, if you think about it, understanding how bacteria work is
actually the only way to find effective protection, and not only from
human madness...There is a bigger menace out there to be worried about:
the pure, crystalline natural cruelty, wiping thousands and thousands of
species out with not a blink of compassion since 4 billions years. In
1918, the so called spanish flu wiped out 6% of the world population of
that time. Six percent. We humans do not accept this harsh treatment
from cruel nature, and we found a way to understand its mechanisms and
use them at our own advantage. Our life today is twice as long and many
times safer than the life of our ancestors, just 100 years ago: think
about living in a world with no anesthesia, no penicillin, no anticancer
drugs, no social security or medical assistance, with sounding remedies
like `skull trepanning <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trepanning>`_,
`bloodletting <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodletting>`_, or
`Hirudotherapy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirudotherapy#Medicinal_use>`_.

Are you really scared of the 21th century ? I'm not.
