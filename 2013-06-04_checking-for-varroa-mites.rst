Checking for Varroa mites

The beekeeping season has started a few months ago, and with the winter
gone and spring revving up, it was time to get the hive ready for the
season, starting with a check for varroa in the drone cells.

Varroa is a parasite mite that attacks larvae and bees. Visible with the
naked eye, it is reddish, quick to move and can be easily spotted either
in the droppings at the bottom of the hive, or attached to the larvae in
the cells. Apparently the mite prefers drones, therefore eliminating the
drones from the brood is an easy method for controlling the mite and
evaluating its diffusion within the hive.

In this movie I took in Germany, we opened drone cells and checked for
the mite.

You can distinguish the drone cells by their "bullet like" shape. Once
opened, the larvae will die but can be used for fishing. The wax can be
recovered by melting the comb in a solar oven and filtrating the liquid
wax.

In Denmark, the technique for varroa/drone handling has been slightly
different. I will show about it in my next post.
