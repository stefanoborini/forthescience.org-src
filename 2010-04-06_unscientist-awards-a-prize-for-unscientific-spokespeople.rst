This is something interesting. What about a `prize for unscientific
claims <http://www.scientificblogging.com/chatter_box/unscientists_2010_awards>`_:
"the Unscientist award"? At the moment, only `Patrick
Lockerby <http://www.scientificblogging.com/profile/patrick_lockerby>`_
(the author of the post linked above) proposes such prize according to
the following rules: the potential candidate must either make use of an
already debunked argument, a logical fallacy, or (verbatim)
"self-aggrandising puerile prosey posturing", to reach and strongly
support an unscientific conclusion going against scientific evidence.

It can be safely assumed that hordes of candidates are available out
there.
