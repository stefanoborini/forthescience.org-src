I recently learned some important information for men. It appears, from
various sources I scouted and `first learned from
reddit <http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/12kihx/pregnant_man_rage/>`_,
that a pregnancy test turning positive for a man may indicate the
presence of testicular cancer. The reason is that pregnancy tests work
by detecting the hormone `human chorionic
gonadotropin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin>`_
(hCG), present in urine and blood after conception. The same hormone is
also present in the urine when some types of cancers are developing,
therefore the presence of a positive result in men `may indicate
presence of these types of
cancer <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_chorionic_gonadotropin#Tumor_marker>`_,
most often found in testicular cancer.

Now, I am not a medical doctor, but a quick search on google scholar led
me to `this
paper <http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowAbstractBuch&ArtikelNr=225555&ProduktNr=245265>`_,
where indeed hCG is considered a viable marker for testicular cancer.
Wikipedia seems to be a reliable source on this regard, and according to
what I found on the web, it's reasonable for me to say that indeed a
pregnancy test can be used by a man to assess a potential testicular
cancer. Like any other medical evaluation, it must however always be
confirmed with additional checks.

I welcome comments or corrections on this regard.
