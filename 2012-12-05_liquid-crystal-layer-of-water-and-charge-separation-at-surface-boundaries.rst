Here is an extremely interesting talk by `Prof. Gerald
Pollack <http://depts.washington.edu/bioe/people/core/pollack.html>`_
about the characteristics of water layers at the surface boundaries. He
presents experimental results supporting the point that water forms a
relatively thick liquid crystal layer at the boundary, establishing a
separation of charge that may be exploited for energy production.
Interestingly, this phenomenon is largely promoted by infrared light.
The same phenomenon may be used for efficient and cost effective water
purification.
