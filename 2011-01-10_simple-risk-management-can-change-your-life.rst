It's always a pleasing experience to change someone's point of view by
introducing him a new, simple concept. When this someone is a friend,
the pleasure is even greater.

A few days ago I had a conversation with a friend, about how to deal
with the uncertainties of life, in particular about employment, marriage
and everything that can have a decisional impact on the future. It was
during this conversation that I introduced him a simple trick I've been
taught during project management courses: `risk assessment and
management <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment>`_.

Suppose you want to start a business, such as a popular social network
site. Roughly, you will hire some people, write some code to provide the
service, and have it run on a computer online, a so called server, and
get people to use it. There are many things that can happen to hinder
your path to success. **Risk assessment** is to evaluate what can go
wrong, how badly it can go wrong, how frequently it can occur, and what
effect has on your path to success (the establishment of a successful
service), examples

-  While you develop your code, a thunderstorm occurs and fries your
   hard drive, thus losing everything you developed since the very
   beginning
-  The service provider that gives you online connectivity while you
   develop occasionally has downtimes, and you are unable to check
   online documentation
-  The server you put your service on occasionally has hiccups,
   rendering it unavailable for hours or even days
-  One of your team members gets sick for a couple of days
-  Issues in the offices require a temporary relocation of the
   programmer team to a different, already organized office for a period
   of time

There are many others, and they most likely depend on the kind of
long-term objective you want to achieve. Once the risk factors (the WHAT
can go wrong) are listed, you need to assign a level of impact (HOW
BADLY it affects the achievement of your goal) and a frequency (HOW
OFTEN it happens). To do this, a useful diagram is the following

`|Risk Assessment

We will explain the meaning of the zones later.

Outcome indicates the effect on your business. There are five levels:

#. Disaster is utter destruction of any chance to achieve the goal.
#. Major trouble is any problem that has a dramatic impact on the
   feasibility of the goal, hindering it into a very late shipping which
   can have important effects on future strategy
#. Nuisance is anything that makes a non-trivial waste of productivity,
   a schedule delay, anything that is not strongly disruptive but still
   it is, well, a nuisance.
#. Minor issue is something that, when occurs, it can be solved quickly
   with minor fuss nor impact on strategy
#. No effect is anything that is irrelevant and represents no threat,
   not even minimal, for the goal.

Frequency is pretty self-explanatory. It indicates how often a given
problem occurs. It's not a matter of days or months. It's a matter of
estimating how frequently an issue comes through while you are working
on your goal. The frequency goes from constant occurrence to no
occurrence.

We now need to classify the problems given above according to the two
scales given above. In some cases, you need to guess. In others, you
probably have actual figures:

-  Fried hard drive with total code loss. Impact: Disaster. Frequency:
   Rare.
-  No internet connection. Impact: Nuisance. Frequency: Sometimes.
-  Hour-wide server hiccup: Impact: Major trouble. Frequency: Sometimes.
   *It makes people look for more reliable services provided by
   competitors.*
-  Sick team member. Impact: Minor issue. Frequency: Rare. *We assume
   the team has another member able to cover the missing person for the
   brief interval. With a one-man team this would have a different
   impact.*
-  Temporary Relocation: Impact: No effect. Frequency: Rare. *We assume
   the programmers just need to plug their laptop and continue working.*

Once the assessment is done, we lay down the points for each assessed
entity on the graph. All the points falling in the "Safe Zone" are
green. We ignore these issues because they represent something having no
real impact on the goal to achieve.

All the points falling in the "Danger Zone" are red. These are serious
problems that must be dealt with, or dire consequences may occur.

Finally, all the points falling on the "Control Zone" are yellow. These
are issues we need to keep under observation, so that we know how to
manage them when they occur.

Now that we concluded the assessment, we need to deal with the problems.
**Risk management** is all about bringing the red points from the Danger
Zone to the Control Zone, that is, on the line. You will probably think
it makes sense to bring them in the "Safe zone", but it's a matter of
cost/benefit balance. In most cases, having the situation "under
control" is just the optimal compromise between costs and benefit. We
have two possible strategies to control the risk: either we find
strategies to reduce the frequency (moving the point along the direction
indicated as 1), or we find strategies to reduce the impact (moving
along 2).

For example, we could reduce the server downtime issue by having two
service providers and balancing the service between the two, so that
it's unlikely that both are unavailable for hours at the same time. This
approach reduces the frequency of the issue into an acceptable range.
The data loss issue can be reduced by having a constant daily backup
schedule, thus reducing the impact (that from total Disaster will
probably skip the Major issue status directly into the Nuisance level,
well into the Safe zone).

Once you learn how this works, you tend to apply it to daily life as
well, ponder the frequency and impact that any event could have, and act
accordingly to prevent uncomfortable situations. Example daily-life
questions:

-  What if I lose my job in 3 years?
-  What if I have an accident and my children and partner are left
   alone?
-  What if I divorce?
-  What if the house needs unexpected renovations?
-  What if I break a finger ?
-  What if the car does not start tomorrow morning?

The major trick of risk assessment is to have reasonable, concrete
estimates for frequency and impact of any issues in the list. In some
topics, such as divorce, or loss of a relative, giving estimates often
involves unpleasant considerations and emotional involvement. It is
important to think with a clear, rational mind when estimating the
occurrence of certain issues, eventually checking real statistics (the
hard numbers), otherwise the assessment will be wrong and when one of
the issues unfortunately occurs, there is going to be big trouble ahead.
