I found this very interesting site about the `periodic table of
elements <http://www.periodicvideos.com/>`_, from the University of
Nottingham. For each element, there's a video showing the
characteristics of the element, and a brief commentary. Worth checking
out if you always had some curiosity about the chemical elements, what
they look like, and how they behave.

They also have a `youtube
channel <http://www.youtube.com/user/periodicvideos>`_ for even more
interesting short movies about chemistry and physics.
