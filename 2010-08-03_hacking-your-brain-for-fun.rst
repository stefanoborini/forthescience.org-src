I just came back from Nolan's latest creation,
`Inception <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/>`_, and I was
completely blown away. The core of the very elaborate plot is the
concept of dreaming and consciousness levels inside dreams, in
particular taking advantage of the science-fiction concept of "shared
dreams". Not unlike in `The
Matrix <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/>`_, questions about "what
is real, what is a dream" are central in the movie.

That brings me to recall my exploration of the dreaming realm. I used to
perform Yoga for a while, and in particular a sub-activity of Yoga
called `Yoga Nidra <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Nidra>`_. It is an
interesting technique that allows you to relax and feel refreshed by
"sleeping" a very short amount of time. It is not a substitute for
regular sleep, though. The idea is to relax under the guide of the
teacher, whose voice instructs you to feel and concentrate your
awareness first on different parts of your body, then to colors and
visual images, in a completely dark and quiet room. The very relaxing
and soothing situation will most likely bring you to fall asleep, and
here is the trick: you must not sleep. Instead, you have to fall asleep
only "`halfway through <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia>`_".
This probably "disables" parts of your brain, allowing you to achieve a
strange state of mind where your brain is awake, but lose consciousness
of your body. An inexperienced person like me is not able to hold this
state for long. It is very subtle and prone to collapse either to full
sleep or to full alertness, but with practice and training it is
possible to keep it stable for a considerable amount of time. I
experienced a floating-like state, or vivid, very real pictures of
landscapes, like they were in front of my eyes.

There's nothing mystic about Yoga Nidra. The brain is a very strange and
complex entity, still far from being understood. At the moment we don't
know how it really works while being awake, asleep, or when involved in
a Yoga meditation, as we don't know many, many other things relatively
to self-awareness, consciousness and dreaming: we don't know why
children are not `self-aware until the 18th month of
age <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test>`_; we don't know why
sometimes we have a
`Deja-vu <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu>`_; we don't
know why we never remember how a dream begins; and we don't know why
even if the dream details are vivid shortly after waking up, they
generally vanish within few minutes with poor or no chance of recalling
them afterward. We don't even know **why** we dream.

What we do know, however, is that the brain is a biological computer, a
`neural network <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network>`_ whose
wiring, weights and operations have been laid out by evolution, primed
during pregnancy and trained during our lifetime to answer the inputs
provided by the external environment. Two consequences should come to no
surprise: that it's a difficult machine to understand, and that it has
"exploits", bugs and "undocumented features", like any other traditional
computer. Our brain is a hackable machine that under proper conditions
and inputs can behave in very strange ways: `lucid
dreams <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dreaming>`_, `out of body
experiences <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience>`_,
`pre-lucid dreams <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-lucid_dream>`_, and
the `false awakenings <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_awakening>`_
(the `Matryoshka <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll>`_
dreams) exploited in Inception. If the system "breaks down", it can
produce temporary or permanent pathologies, such as
`depression <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder>`_,
`seizures <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure>`_,
`schizophrenia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia>`_, and
`hallucinations <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination>`_ among
others. The brain is such powerful sensation and perception processor
that it can create symptoms for an illness as real as the actual
pathology, even when `no actual cause
exists <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatoform_disorder>`_. It can get
a woman to `feel and show the full symptoms of a
pregnancy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_pregnancy>`_ even if
there's no developing fetus at all. These phenomena are found in animals
as well. I personally witnessed a false pregnancy in my `Great
Dane <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dane>`_, as well as various
level of `dog dreaming <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2BgjH_CtIA>`_.

I suggest to give Yoga Nidra a try. It's a highly instructive and
pleasant activity that allows an easy, accessible and harmless
experiment with your brain.
