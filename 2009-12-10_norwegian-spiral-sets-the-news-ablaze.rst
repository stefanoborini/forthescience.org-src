You have probably read or heard about the `Norwegian
spiral <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Norway_spiral_light>`_ and
you have `probably also seen it
somehow <http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=search_videos&search_query=norway+spiral>`_.
Of course, what's the best answer to an unexplained phenomenon ? UFOs,
aliens, black holes! I won't link any material, you can find it
everywhere. I will instead link the only `rational analysis of the
phenomenon <http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/12/09/awesomely-bizarre-light-show-freaks-out-norway/>`_.
Thanks to Phil Plait, which is always a pleasure to read.

So, what was it? the spiral pattern is interesting, and the fact that it
was only visible from Norway as well. The first fact indicates something
that rotates while ejecting something, producing therefore a spiral. The
second fact indicates something that is quite low in orbit, otherwise it
would have been visible from many other places. The brightness of the
observed fact is due to the sun.

Ok so, a rotating object ejecting something that brightens up in
sunlight and it's quite low in altitude... something like, a spent
rocket?

But no! Both Norway and Russia deny any rocket launch. Of course they
are telling the truth, so it must be alien technology! Of course...
yeah, right...

Update: ok, so apparently it was confirmed and known that a rocket
launch was to occur. Here is a link to a
`NAVTEX <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navtex>`_
`message <http://www.frisnit.com/cgi-bin/navtex/view.cgi?id=1159919&lan=en&type=24H&message_filter=&search=ROCKET&station_filter=&date=2009-12-09&source=a4f7a470329caf85e2488355c7e88328&offset=0>`_
about a rocket launch occurring in the area.
