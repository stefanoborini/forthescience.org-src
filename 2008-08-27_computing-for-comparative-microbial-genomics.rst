I am proud to announce that `Springer <http://www.springer.com>`_ has
finally released on the web (and
`Amazon <http://www.amazon.com/Computing-Comparative-Microbial-Genomics-Microbiologists/dp/1848002548>`_
as well) the descriptive information of the textbook I took part on:
`Computing for Comparative Microbial
Genomics <http://www.springer.com/computer/computational+biology+and+bioinformatics/book/978-1-84800-254-8>`_.
It was a fantastic and incredible experience, for which I will always be
grateful to Dave Ussery, my supervisor at Technical University of
Denmark, and to Trudy Wassenaar, an independent professional and
Associate Professor at the same institute.

Together with the book, I deployed a supplemental information website,
`comparativemicrobial.com <http://comparativemicrobial.com>`_. At the
moment, it does not contain much information, apart of some biographies
and a couple of links. We expect to enrich it with simple tutorial code
and up-to-date news as time passes, following the feedback we obtain
from the readers.

EDIT: specified that only the description is available on the web, not
the textbook itself ;)
