Geologic clock and evolution

Today I was taking a look at `this
page <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Earth>`_, and in
particular to the geological clock image

Of course there's uncertainty on the correctness of the actual moments
in time, but assuming these values are more or less correct it is quite
interesting to note that it took only 500 million years to go from a
highly destructive event like the formation of the moon (which is
thought to be occurred via an `impact
event <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_impact_hypothesis>`_) to the
first "protolife" able to replicate and improve itself, definitely
something quite complex.

Only 500 million years were then needed to start photosynthesis, another
quite complex affair. With this process started, it took almost 2
billion years to increase the oxygen level sensibly (testifying the
diffusion of life forms on the Earth), and for Prokaryotes to `start
collaborating <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endosymbiotic_theory>`_ and
create Eukaryotic cells: 2 billion years of pure Prokaryote evolution,
from protolife to something complex enough to start a superior organism.
A lot of time, in particular considering that it was only some thousands
of years ago that a new subspecie of Lactobacillus, the Bulgaricus,
`become specialized in fermented milk
environment <http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/103/24/9274>`_ (see
also
`here <http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/060609_yogurt_bacteria.html>`_),
and many bacteria develop strong `antibiotic
resistance <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance>`_ in a
very short time, leading to a race between humans and pathogens, or
better, humans and evolution.

This looks amazing, and quite puzzling. The development of a complex
mechanism like photosynthesis, or even the generation of a protolife
able to evolve by itself, took less than a third of the time needed for
the Prokaryotic/Eukaryotic step, a period of time where an incredible
amount of mutations, `lateral
transfers <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer>`_,
reductions ad rearrangements happened on their genetic code.

Further aggregation to multicellular organisms took other 700 million
years. After other 800 million years, the first animals, and in only 300
million years we have the `Cambrian
explosion <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion>`_. Then
everything skyrockets. In the remaining 600 million years we have
plants, insects, reptiles, mammals, and the man.

Edit: rewrote wrongly written statement.
