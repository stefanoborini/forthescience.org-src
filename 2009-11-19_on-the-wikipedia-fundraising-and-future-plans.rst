On the Wikipedia fundraising and future plans

Wikimedia fundation is organizing another round of fundraising to
support Wikipedia. I wish to remember that the English version currently
contains more than 3 millions pages.

Wikipedia is one of the most impressive and revolutionary achievement of
the internet crowd. It changed the way culture is made available.
Wikipedia is important for all of us. `So please consider
donating <http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Support_Wikipedia/en?utm_source=2009_Notice30&utm_medium=sitenotice&utm_campaign=fundraiser2009&referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMain_Page&target=Support_Wikipedia>`_.
The target is currently at 7.5 million dollars, with one million already
collected. It's still quite a way to go, but it can be achieved.

I want to take this post to add a bit of information about what's going
on behind the scenes here at ForTheScience. I have two posts in
preparation, plus a large set of projects to manage. I will give a sneak
preview:

-  I started the `Wavemol <http://wavemol.org>`_ project: tools for
   quantum chemists. My intention is to provide tools and documentation
   for computational and quantum chemists, and create a community around
   the website. At the moment, the website redirects here, but I will
   change this as soon as possible. Help very welcome!
-  I am developing a database for computational chemistry information,
   to be published under the Wavemol project *aegis*. The project makes
   use of python+django+RDF+REST. If anyone is interested in helping me,
   he is very welcome. I can provide mentoring on the status via skype
   or mail. The project is cool! If you want to learn about the above
   technologies, this is a great opportunity. `The project is available
   on launchpad <https://code.launchpad.net/~wavemol/wavemol>`_.
-  I am writing two more posts on ForTheScience. One is about
   hyperpolarizabilities and another is about quantum mechanics in
   general. They take some time to prepare, as the post on the
   non-newtonian fluids, so always keep into account that when you read
   something, it's old and I am already working on something new.
-  I would like to provide Physical Chemistry course notes straight from
   my personal notes at the university. I recovered them from two
   friends of mine, Roberto Forlani and Raffaele Giordani, whom I really
   want to thank and acknowledge. I will have to translate (they are in
   Italian) and retype them in DocBook (they are in dead-tree format)
   but rest assured, I will manage.
-  I would like to provide more features to Chestnut Package Manager. In
   the last 6 months, the program has been downloaded an average of 30
   times a month, not much, but far beyond my (slim) expectations of one
   or two a month. I'd like to provide dependencies and to put the
   program on the Python Package Index, so if you would like to help,
   you are mostly welcome!
-  I moved the RSS feed to feedburner, so to get better statistics.
-  and more...

Yes, more indeed, but I definitely need 48 hours/day!
