There have been quite some changes in the past 24 hours, and a few more
will follow:

-  I changed the theme to Garland. I kept the green theme because I like
   it and it's the traditional color of the chemistry degree in my
   native city. The theme is not perfect, and I am tweaking it as I
   write. I will also have to check past posts to see if they behave
   correctly.
-  As a passionate (but inexperienced) beekeeper and gardener, I decided
   to start a new blog at
   `Gaia.ForTheScience.org <http://gaia.forthescience.org>`_. It will
   mainly focus on my personal adventures in outdoor and
   non-computer-related activities, such as gardening, beekeeping, and
   cooking (Italian cooking, specifically), with a scientific eye and
   strong accent on discovery and experimentation that can be useful to
   others. I decided for the split because I expect the audience to be
   different: I already have plenty of movies and pictures to post, but
   I felt this blog as not appropriate for this content.
-  I removed the failed experiment of wavemol.org, which I started
   during a relatively well-received, but not financed application for a
   Marie Curie grant I applied for. After the grant was declined, I kept
   the domain trying to reinvent its purpose, but I found myself not
   particularly driven to do any more work on it. For a while, I helped
   a friend and hosted the p4vasp code, and received good traffic, but
   after the code was moved to a dedicated site, the traffic declined to
   spambots and I decided to terminate it for good. The URL now
   redirects to this blog.
-  I will soon remove WPML translations. The plugin has gone commercial,
   and I am not posting a lot in Italian to justify the transition. I
   don't know how the current Italian posts will be handled after the
   removal, but my guess is that they will collapse into the current
   blog timeline. I might still post in Italian and provide translation
   posts, but they will appear directly in the current progression. I
   doubt this will be excessively annoying for current readers, as I
   normally post translations when the English post is no longer on the
   main page or the RSS scope.
-  I removed the redundant twitter lateral pane, leaving more screen for
   code and scripts that occasionally ended up being hard to read or to
   copy/paste. I will keep posting updates on twitter every time there's
   a new post (it's automatic)
