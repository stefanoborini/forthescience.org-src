As you probably recall, some time ago I proposed to `associate
scientific dissemination and research to a
symbol <http://forthescience.org/blog/2010/10/25/an-initiative-to-promote-science-through-a-symbol-tulips/>`_.
I chose this symbol to be the tulip, and I planted some bulbs. As winter
will turn into spring soon, they start peeking out of the cold soil

Satisfying! This year, I decided to donate my royalties to
`Telethon <http://www.telethon.it/>`_, as soon as the tulips are ready
to be donated as well.
