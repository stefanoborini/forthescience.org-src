New style, new direction

As you can see, I did some deep changes to the website. My hosting at bluehost
is expiring and my needs have changed since I started. I am overall happy
with bluehost, they are a great, reliable hosting, but I don't need their
services anymore.  I migrated my wordpress deployment to a static website
written in reStructuredText and compiled to HTML with pelican. I then host both
the reST and the HTML at github.

This approach requires a bit more manual work, but I think it's worth the
savings and the simple technology behind it. In the process, I also got rid of
the heavily spammed wordpress comment system and introduced google plus comments.

In the meantime, I decided to shift in focus. In the past I occasionally wrote
about science in general. This will no longer happen, and I will post and focus
exclusively on scientific programming and related issues, with a general bias
toward python. I will try to keep some form of regularity in my posting
frequency, but considering the increased manual work required, there will be
more variability.

Currently, I am working on the following long term projects:

    - I am writing `a book on Model View Controller <http://stefanoborini.github.io/modelviewcontroller/>`_.
      The `sources are available here <https://github.com/stefanoborini/modelviewcontroller-src>`_. 
    - I am writing `vai, a vim clone in python <https://github.com/stefanoborini/vai>`_, with ambitions
      to become a textual IDE.
    - I wrote `Python PEP-472 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0472/>`_, and I will have to deploy 
      an implementation for it.
    - A bit of other lateral activities in a too early stage to be relevant at the moment.
    - and of course, this blog and its nature-oriented one, gaia (which I haven't ported yet).
    
As you can see, I am overinvolved, which is quite typical for me. Since I am
only one, I jump from one project to another in a round robin way. Don't assume
a project is dead because you don't see changes. I am probably working on
something else and I'll go back to it at a later stage.
