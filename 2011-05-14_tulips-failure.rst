I am really sad to report my utter (but expected) failure with green
stuff: the tulips died. `From really green
sprouts <http://forthescience.org/blog/2011/02/07/tulips/>`_ they
suddenly became yellow and died within a week. This is the cold body
aftermath

I have no idea of what went wrong, but I will try again next year. What
hasn't failed however, is `the associated
donation <http://forthescience.org/blog/2010/10/25/an-initiative-to-promote-science-through-a-symbol-tulips/>`_.
I did not receive a lot from the book royalties this year, but I doubled
that amount and donated it to `Telethon <http://telethon.it>`_.
