Nothing says relax better than a peaceful evening in front of a steamy cup of
chamomile. Since thousands of years, humanity uses it as a natural
remedy for a large amount of ailments, most notably hypertension,
sleeplessness and to ease a flu-dominated night, like in my case
recently.

Moved by curiosity, I took some time investigating what is
scientifically known about the therapeutic effects of chamomile and
their mechanism of action. The results, I must say, are interesting and
conflicting. Let's examine what I was able to gather from around the
internet and in a couple of scientific papers.

Chamomile is a class of plants whose main representatives, at least for
infuse-making, are `Matricaria recutita
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matricaria_recutita>`_ (German
chamomile) and `Chamaemelum nobile or Anthemis nobilis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthemis_nobilis>`_ (Common
Chamomile). It can be found wild or cultivated. Its flower is actually a
composite daisy-like sprout. The flowers are the tiny yellow corollae
forming the central bulb.

The pleasant fragrance the chamomile flowers produce arises from a large
set of compounds (more than 120) including in particular
`sesquiterpenes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesquiterpenes>`_ such as
`chamazulene <http://www.drugfuture.com/chemdata/chamazulene.html>`_ and
alpha-`bisabolol <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisabolol>`_, `flavonoids
and flavanoids <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid>`_, like
`Chrysin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysin>`_, and many others. Most
of these compounds are not present in free-form, but are bound to sugars
through fragile bonds that can be broken easily, for example by heating.

Some research on the effects of these compounds has been performed. In
particular, Chamazulene has been found to have `antioxidant
properties <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7997466>`_, together with
`matricin <http://www.nextbio.com/b/search/ov/matricin>`_,
alpha-bisabolol, and
`apigenin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apigenin>`_. Chrysin appears to
show `anxiolytic effect in laboratory
rats <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17966676>`_ (see also
`[1] <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0091-3057(94)90103-1>`_ and
`[2] <http://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fptr.1900>`_) but nothing has been
said for humans yet.

Other experiments show that `chamomile can have small antibacterial
effect on the gut's bacterial
population <http://www.emsb.qc.ca/laurenhill/science/chamomile.pdf>`_,
both in human and rat. This finding, however, is a mere hypothesis to
explain changes in the excreted substances.

So, it appears that chamomile does indeed have relevant activity, and
for what concerns anxiolytic effects, some evidence exists. Despite
this, The `National Institute of Health page for
chamomile <http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/patient-chamomile.html>`_
reports insufficient evidence for most of the claimed therapeutical
advantages of chamomile: the report is "C: Unclear scientific evidence
for this use", with only one case ("post-operation sore throat") where a
conclusion has been reached as "D: Fair scientific evidence against this
use". This is a very important example on how evaluation of
pharmacological effectiveness is performed. Even when evidence supports
presence of therapeutic effect from a given compound or preparation,
only a set rigorous tests performed on human subjects allows to finally
grant recognition of therapeutic effectiveness (or lack of it). In the
case of chamomile, tests have been mainly performed in rats and mice.
Even a single successful (or unsuccessful) human test is not enough to
grant A (strong positive evidence) or F (strong negative evidence)
grades in the `Natural
Standard <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Standard>`_ `grading
scale <http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/grading.html>`_.
The grade C refers specifically to

   #. Evidence of benefit from >1 small randomized trials without adequate
      size, power, statistical significance, or quality of design by
      objective criteria, OR
   #. conflicting evidence from multiple randomized trials without a clear
      majority of the properly conducted trials showing evidence of benefit
      or ineffectiveness, OR
   #. evidence of benefit from >1 cohort/case-control/non-randomized
      trials AND without supporting evidence in basic science, animal
      studies, or theory, OR
   #. evidence of efficacy only from basic science, animal studies, or
      theory.

Let's examine the cases one by one.

The first case occurs when tests result in positive evidence (it works)
but the test is not "statistically significant" meaning that it has been
performed on too few subjects: for something to be considered working,
it must present an effect that occurs with some consistency. If you test
a substance Foo on a single sick person, and he recovers, it does not
mean that Foo is a cure. That person could have recovered just because
he was lucky or strong enough to recover, regardless of Foo. A better
test would be: treat 200 sick people with Foo, and take also 200 sick
people with no Foo treatment, then compare the recovery rate in the two
groups. If in the first group 180 people recover, while in the other
only 20 recover, there's definitely a good point in favour for Foo being
effective in curing that sickness. Statistical analysis allows you to
decide which numbers of people can be considered strong evidence or not
enough evidence for Foo being an effective cure.

The second case is when two or more tests produce conflicting results.
For example if laboratory A sees a recover in its people using Foo, but
laboratory B sees no recover. There could be many reasons for this.
Improper testing could be one, and even if all tests are performed
properly there could be additional factors we don't know. Example:
suppose that people at laboratory A had an unknown strong ease of
recovery from that sickness (because they are immune for some biological
reason), so the group without Foo medication recovers as well as the
group without Foo. The conclusion for the laboratory A is that Foo has
no effect, while laboratory B says that Foo has an effect. This is
conflicting evidence, and must be resolved by checking more people,
until a clear majority allows a unique conclusion to be drawn.

The third case is when there is evidence for recover, but there's no
evidence from known science, animal studies or theory able to explain
the observed phenomenon. This can lead to a scientific breakthrough if a
new biological mechanism is found and explained, but until then, it is
not possible to say anything about the pharmacological validity. This
point also raises the difference from cohort case, control case,
randomized or non-randomized trial. It would be an interesting
discussion, but it goes a bit outside of my current knowledge, and I am
determined to learn more about the details in the future.

The fourth and last case is when evidence exists only because we infer
it should work from what we known today of the human body's mechanisms,
but no actual test has been performed, or tests have been performed only
on animals.

In the case of chamomile, as of today we cannot confirm officially and
with strong evidence on humans that a pharmacological effect does
exists, because all tests have been performed on animals, with the very
few human trials available still insufficient to draw significant
conclusions. This does not mean that the effect does not exists. It
could exists, or it could not, and whatever the truth is we cannot put
an approval stamp on it yet, because we haven't tested enough. In
agreement to the scientific method, unless something is demonstrated via
evidence to hold, it is assumed not to hold. It's like presumption of
innocence in criminal trials: someone is assumed innocent until proven
guilty from evidence. The other way around would be disastrous.

Now, we can probably claim that the pure fact of preparing chamomile and
enjoying its pleasant fragrance has a relaxing effect, but that would be
a psychological effect triggering internal biochemical actions inside
our body, finally leading to a relaxed mood. Mozart could have the same
effect. The point is, **from the pharmaceutical point of view, the
correct answer (as of today) to the question "does chamomile really
relax ?" is "some evidence exists that it does, but it's still not
enough to say for sure."**
