I added `reCaptcha <http://recaptcha.net>`_ to the comments. reCaptcha
is a Captcha system, one of those systems that tries to understand if
you are a human or an automatic program (a bot, normally for spamming).
This normally consist in asking you to type the letters from an image, a
task that a human can do easily, but a computer can't. Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) methods could potentially be used by a program who
tries to eavesdrop the system, but they are not very accurate, in
particular if the text is highly distorted, or noise is added to the
image.

reCaptcha puts the concept to another level. It exploit the many small
human contributions put into solving captchas to `digitize
books <http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html>`_. Therefore, the more
comments you write, the faster those books are converted into digital
form.
