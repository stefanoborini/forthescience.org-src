Take a look at this robot

Impressive, isn't it ? Astonishing I would say. It moves like a human.
We were told how the future would have looked like, and then one day we
look around and the future is here, now. There was one day where the
future became the present, and we did not realize that.

Ok, I won't expect to see humanoid robots walking around soon. In
particular because the robot you just saw is, in fact, `a human with a
nice costume <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_the_Robot>`_. Sorry to
disappoint you, what you saw is still the future. But for how long ? In
a few years, someone will present a humanoid robot with that agility,
and this time it will be the real deal. We already have `robots that
run <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3C5sc8b3xM>`_, `play
violin <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzjkBwZtxp4>`_,
`dance <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vwZ5FQEUFg>`_, `solve
puzzles <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNAnUygqOYc>`_, and `pretend to
be humans <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sjV_lxSVQo>`_, ending up
straight into the `uncanny
valley <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley>`_.
