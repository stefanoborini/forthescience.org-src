Remember when I posted about the `lovely but fake Titan
robot <http://forthescience.org/blog/2009/10/23/when-the-future-is-the-present/>`_,
and I told you the future was close? Well, some time passed, and the
future is now even closer. New robots are among us, and they are
learning. Some of them prefer to stay at home, `folding our
clothes <http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-03/video-adorable-laundry-folding-robot-gives-special-love-rectangular-pieces-cloth>`_,
`washing our
dishes <http://www.popsci.com/gadgets/article/2010-04/dishbot-cleans-house-learns-live-uncertainty>`_
or `bringing drinks and staying with us, acting as
tables <http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-06/two-wheeled-robotic-table-balances-drinks-segway-style>`_.
If you are at home wasting time in front of the computer, you could
`just ask one to bring you a
beer <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3Cq0sy4TBs>`_.

Some of them decided to find a job outside, so they `pick
strawberries <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4HnFgqvIKk>`_, `administer
weddings <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8685184.stm>`_, or `wash our hair
with the power of sixteen
fingers <http://www.goodgearguide.com.au/article/362074/panasonic_unleashes_16-finger_hair_washing_robot/>`_.
`If we are sick, they may go to school for us, and relay the
lesson <http://singularityhub.com/2011/02/02/texas-student-attends-school-as-a-robot-a-sign-of-things-to-come-video/>`_.
Sometimes during breaks they can lose themselves in the big city, `so
you could meet one of them asking for
directions <http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-06/little-lost-robot-asks-way>`_.
Maybe `they will take a bike ride to get to the
pub <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Srwk-i5aXRQ>`_, and `play
pool <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AENJxqR0g48>`_.

Robots can also act as our trusted pet friends, and although they will
never replace them, they can become quite interesting marvels of
technology. Sony Aibo was the first robot dog commercially available. I
played with one, and it's an amazing little thingie. These two, however,
bring the doggy robot to a whole new level: `small
dog <http://www.walyou.com/blog/2010/05/30/little-mechanic-dog-robot/>`_
or `big dog <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2bExqhhWRI>`_, the choice
is yours. And speaking about animal robots, you can also have a
`tree-climbing snake <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VLjDjXzTiU>`_, a
`crawling
snake <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJuNe50uuzk&feature=related>`_, a
`bug-like thingie that both walks and
rolls <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH0DDLBvF5g&feature=related>`_, a
`fish <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eO9oseiCTdk>`_, a
`spider <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNXuzhop-u8&feature=related>`_.

They are also into performing arts. They can `dance the Bolero, and they
are damn good at it <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIuRc1r_N34>`_
(really, take your time with that video, it's pure mechanical beauty),
or some `other dance
maybe <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vwZ5FQEUFg&feature=related>`_?
With
`violin <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzjkBwZtxp4&feature=related>`_
they are not yet Uto Ughi, but they are improving. With `trumpet they
are already pretty good <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fYMxaBTqls>`_,
apparently. As for sport and outdoor, they can `learn archery
skills <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCXvAqIDpIw&feature=player_embedded>`_,
or and `some of them <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOi37NikdpM>`_ very
soon will ask us to become `a real
boy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Pinocchio>`_.
