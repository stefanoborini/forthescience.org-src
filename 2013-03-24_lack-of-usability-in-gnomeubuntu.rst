Lack of usability in Gnome/Ubuntu

Maybe I should file a bug report on this, but it's a nice example of
lack of usability due to colliding needs: the need for a scrollbar in
the terminal, and the need for window resizing.

As you can see, the popup scrollbar always follows the mouse pointer,
making it impossible to get the resize operation. This happens in the
bottom-right corner as well. The only way to perform resizing is to
either use the top right corner, or to "trick" the scrollbar by moving
the mouse pointer in a particular way, something made even more
difficult by the fact that this area is one or two pixels wide.

This is so wrong from the usability point of view that I am surprised
nobody caught it.
