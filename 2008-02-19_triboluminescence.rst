Triboluminescence

A few days ago I received a letter. While opening it, I was able to spot
a considerably bright blue luminescence coming from the line where the
glue separated. I heard many times about this phenomenon, but never able
to witness it. It is called
`triboluminescence <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triboluminescence>`_,
and arises by charge separation created by the mechanical stress. When
charges recombine, light emission occurs, normally a very beautiful
electric blue.

Apparently, you can generate this effect in many ways. The rubber-like
glue you can find in some envelopes is one possibility, but many
minerals also exhibit the same phenomenon, some
`candies <http://chemistry.about.com/cs/howthingswork/a/aa060601a.htm>`_
and plain sugar.

Of course, this led me to crush sugar with a glass in a dark room.
Although I believe I was able to spot something, I cannot really say for
sure. The room was not 100% dark, and some spurious light could arise
from reflections on the glass, tricking me.

Despite this part of the experiment being not conclusive, I can confirm
the second part: crushing sugar in a dark kitchen means sugar dust
everywhere.
