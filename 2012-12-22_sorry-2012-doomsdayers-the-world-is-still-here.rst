Yesterday, `according to the 2012
doomsdayers <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon>`_, was
supposed to be the end of the world. Sorry, the world is still here, but
don't worry, there will be a new proposed date soon in the queue to
delight once again humanity. Interestingly, unless someone proposes an
earlier one, Isaac Newton's prediction is the next one, with an
estimated end of the world for 2060. I have the feeling that `2038, the
year where all UNIX dates will flip back
1901 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem>`_, is another
likely candidate. Remember Y2K ?

`Considering the frequency of such
announcements <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_predictions>`_, we
may be tempted to say that sooner or later someone is going to hit
jackpot. James Randi, famous magician and debunker, uses the same
approach: every morning, he puts a new business card in his pocket, with
the words "`I, James Randi, will die
today <http://www.psyfitec.com/2010/08/james-randi-and-seer-sucker-illusion.html>`_"
followed by the current date. Imagine the amazement of those who will
find him dead. Reality, however, is different. In 5 billion years, our
Sun will grow into a red giant and swallow our planet, an event that
won't take place in one day. It will be a progressive change, so it will
be hard to assign "the day when the Sun cooked us all".

If we limit ourselves to extinction (or really strong reduction) of the
human species, this may indeed actually happen rather soon and quickly.
Meteorites actually do hit the planet from time to time, and a `large
impact may trigger mass extinctions like it did in the
past <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Tertiary_extinction_event>`_,
but we don't have to wait from problems from above. We live in an
overpopulated planet, in exponential population growth, and way beyond
the carrying capacity in absence of fossil fuels. I think we should
focus on the real problems of humanity, instead of Mayan calendars.
