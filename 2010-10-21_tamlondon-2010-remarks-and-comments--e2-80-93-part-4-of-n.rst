**Notable talks**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**`Susan Blackmore <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Blackmore>`_**
presented an excerpt of her first years of research on paranormal. She
shows intriguing statistics on paranormal evaluation, describes some
techniques used for `cold
reading <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_reading>`_. A consistent part
of her talk was relative to physiological explanations of different
phenomena our minds perceive as paranormal or mystic. More specifically,
she touches arguments such as `sensory
deprivation <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_deprivation>`_, `sleep
paralysis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis>`_, `the
structure of the visual
cortex <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex>`_ and the `Olaf
Blanke
experiments <http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/2007/08/experimentallyinduced_outofbod.php>`_
(see also `here <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-jDhJhSNKI>`_). All
these techniques and experimental setups provide good explanations for
perceived paranormal events, such as `ghost
appearances <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparitional_experience>`_,
`alien abductions <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_abduction>`_,
`light tunnels <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_of_light>`_ and
`out-of-body
experiences <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience>`_.

**`Richard Dawkins <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins>`_**
held a thoughtful and poised talk on the preciousness of scientific
literature to be considered classic education, while scouting the broad
number of scientific disciplines describing the mechanism of our world
and life in particular. Dawkins presents a talk both source and
inspiration of great quotes, enticing the audience with a profound
philosophical vision: "`*Science is uplifting, inspirational, poetry of
reality* <http://twitter.com/#%21/thelucidmind/status/27525567509>`_",
"`*If more of our political masters understood statistics, the world
would be a better
place* <http://twitter.com/#%21/mjrobbins/status/27527537203>`_". The
`humbling tree of
life <http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2006/12/the_tree_of_life.php>`_
shows our position in the evolutionary development, a twig of a deeply
branched bush covering animals, plants, fungi, bacteria.

In addition to its high philosophical tone, the talk presents real case
scientific scenarios for disparate arguments, such as: flight stability
strategies in dinosaurs and birds to reach the optimal compromise
between stability and ease of flight versus instability and high
manoeuvrability; `Computational evolutionary
optimization <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm>`_ of
windmills and fuel injectors nozzles to achieve the best performance;
and evolution of human language, maybe the best platform to explain and
demonstrate evolutionary concepts to the general public.

**`Cory Doctorow <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow>`_**
presented a talk about copyright and the historical background of
Intellectual Property (in the early days known as creative monopoly). In
his words, Doctorow says that "yesterday's pirates are today's
admirals", referring to how past piracy allowed development of companies
that are now brands with worldwide recognition and technologies whose
revolutionary nature changed our lifestyle. Doctorow presents an example
of copyright stifling innovation for databases: while in UK any
collection of data was protected under IPR laws, in US no such
protection was present, allowing the creation of an incredible amount of
databases, and consequently better associated services.

**` <http://kejames.com/>`_`|image2| <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HMSBeagle.jpg>`_Karen
James** talked about `the Beagle
Project <http://www.thebeagleproject.com/>`_, finalized at rebuilding a
replica of the `HMS Beagle <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hms_beagle>`_
and set sail along Darwin's travel to promote scientific dissemination,
improve public engagement with science and encourage young people to
become scientists. As I am starting a sailing course as a crew member
next spring, this project hit me on the sweet spot, dreaming to be part
of this incredible travel.

A board discussion held by **Paula Kirby** focused on skeptical
activism. Most of my comments were presented in my previous post. The
discussion produced interesting resources worth checking out, such as
"`Sense about Science <http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/>`_" and the
evidence-based policy initiative from the "`Nightingale
collaboration <http://www.nightingale-collaboration.org/>`_". These
initiatives are all UK-centric. I personally asked a question about
similar initiatives and strategic networking with other European
countries. Let's see if it grows into something.

The talk given by **`Marcus
Chown <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Chown>`_** goes through
recent discoveries to provide a mindblowing list of scientific oddities.
Did you know that the Sun uses a very inefficient nuclear reaction to
produce energy, and it's due to its inefficiency that it lasts enough
for us to be here ? What about the fact that if you are at the ground
floor you age slower than being at the first floor, and very accurate
clocks are able to measure this difference even between two stair steps
? Did you know that a small percent of the white noise you see on an
untuned TV is actually the echo of the Big Bang ? Marcus provides a
brilliant and really pleasant talk, both conceptually and visually.

Finally, JREF president **D. J. Grothe** and **P. Z. Myers** gave two
different talks with overlap and disagreements, concerns skeptic
activism and atheism. Grothe points at the need for skeptics not to be
"dicks" in their positions, and have a tender heart with a tough mind.
`I share his point of view, and I wrote about the same topic some weeks
ago <http://forthescience.org/blog/2010/09/13/the-challenges-of-scientific-communication/6/>`_.
P. Z. Myers on the other hand claims a different, more intransigent
attitute, in particular when it concerns skepticism on religious issues,
i.e. atheism "Do be a dick. Be the best dick you can be." or, in his
words "do be a Richard".

Myers' point is supported by his observation that by their very nature,
atheists are "honest, assertive, humorous, angry, critical, militant,
scientific, uncompromising, rude". I don't share his point of view on
some of these terms, but I do agree that for some people, even the pure
questioning of a belief (regardless of it being religious or not) is
automatically classified as rude, no matter how positive assertiveness
and smiles you can put in presenting your evidence. I already wrote
about the case: haters gonna hate, stick their fingers in their ears and
start singing. No matter how much evidence is carried, people don't like
to be proven wrong, and they will continue using their "miracle cure" or
"magic bracelet". In this sense, Myers says that when there's basically
no possible way of not being classified as a dick, the solution is to
try to be the best dick possible.

A comment on Grothe/Myers Talks
-------------------------------

My opinion on the point raised by Myers is different: you should choose
your goals wisely, and work **for** something, **not against**
something, with patience, passion, and righteousness. While it's clear
that immediate and firm stance must be taken against people selling
poison or sugar for medicine, or scamming old people and grieving
mothers, or giving a free pass to intolerance and discrimination, the
long term goal for skeptics should be to increase scientific education,
promote correct popularization of science, explain with a clear and
accessible language, and dispel fear and myths. These, in my opinion,
are the productive long terms goals skeptics should focus on.

This is my last post regarding TAM London 2010. I want to thank the
speakers, the audience and the organizers for the fantastic experience.

In an upcoming post, in a couple of days, I will introduce a symbolic
action I am going to take to promote goodwill and personal growth, while
making someone happy in the meantime. My hope is that other people will
appreciate this idea, so that it becomes a pleasant activity and
potentially a way to promote skepticism and concrete actions towards
better science. After this upcoming post, it will be back to science at
ForTheScience.
